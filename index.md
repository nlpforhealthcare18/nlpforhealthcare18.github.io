### Ethics

<br><br>
We love open data! Fortunately, on this workship all data we are working with is just that. However, we also need to recognise that weâ€™re still at work as Civil Servants, and so need to reflect this in the way we handle this data, the analysis we carry out, and the way we talk about the findings.



<br><br>
### Topics
<br><br>
During the workshop we are going to cover the topics of:
<br><br>
**Data preperation**

Dealing with, preparing and tokenizing unstructured data
<br><br>
**Data cleansing**

Stop words, stemming, and other cleaning methods
<br><br>
**Understanding the data**

Identifing themes within the data, autoclassification
<br><br>
**Data analysis**

Topic Modelling/ Bayes Classifer
<br><br>
With the aim to answer questions such as:

**Can we identify specific themes from inspection reports such as person centred care and deprivation of liberty safeguards?**
<br><br>
