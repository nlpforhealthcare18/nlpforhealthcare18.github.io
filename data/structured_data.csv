The first day of the inspection was  unannounced, which meant the staff and registered provider did not know we would be visiting.  We  informed the registered provider of our visit on 7 March 2017.  When we last inspected the service in July  2014 we found that the registered provider was meeting the legal requirements in the areas that we looked  at and rated the service as good.    Nunthorpe Oaks provides care and accommodation for up to 56 older people some of whom were living  with dementia.  The service is purpose built with accommodation provided over two floors and this includes  communal lounge and dining areas. There are garden areas surrounding the building.  At the time of the  inspection there were total of 54 people who used the service.    The home had a registered manager.  A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.    People received a consistently high standard of care because staff were led by an experienced and proactive registered manager.  The staff team were highly motivated and enthusiastic, and committed to ensuring  each person had a good quality of life.  There was a clear management structure in place and oversight from the registered provider.  There were systems in place to monitor the safety and drive the continuous  improvement of the quality of the service provided.  A comprehensive programme of audits and checks were in place to monitor all aspects of the service, including care delivery, accidents and incidents, health and  safety, infection prevention and control and medicines.  Audits resulted in clear action plans to address  shortfalls or areas of improvement.   The registered manager displayed exceptional leadership qualities, drive and enthusiasm.  They empowered staff to provide outstanding care that was tailored to individual's needs.  Without exception people, their  relatives and professionals told us they experienced and we observed compassionate care from staff who  strove for excellence.  This ensured the service was run in the best interest of people who used the service.    People received care and support in an exceptionally personalised way. Staff knew people well, understood  their needs and the way they communicated if they were living with dementia. Care was focused on people's wishes and preferences. This meant people were able to maintain their independence and achieve a good  sense of self-worth and wellbeing. The impact this had on people was outstanding and had resulted in them being settled, content and helped them to lead as full and active lives as they wanted to.  Staff developed exceptionally positive and caring relationships with people and their families. Staff were  very motivated and demonstrated a commitment to providing the best quality care to individuals in a  compassionate way. People's privacy and dignity was maintained at all times during the inspection. Health   2 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  professionals told us people received end of life care that was exemplary, and that staff worked closely with  the community nursing team to ensure people and their family were treated with dignity and respect, and  that their individual preferences were considered at all times.   People's independence was actively encouraged. The registered manager and staff displayed clear resolve  to make a positive difference to people's lives.  Activities were invigorating, outings and events were well  thought through, varied and in plentiful supply.  Staff encouraged and supported people to access activities  within the community.  There were meaningful activities for people living with dementia.   Assessments were undertaken to identify people's care, health and support needs.  There was a strong  emphasis on person centred care.  People and their families were at the centre of decision making whilst  working alongside professionals to get the best outcome possible.  Care plans were developed with people  who used the service and relatives to identify how they wanted to be supported.    People were protected by the services approach to safeguarding and whistle blowing.  People who used the  service told us they felt safe and could tell staff if they were unhappy.  People told us staff treated them well  and they were happy with the care and service received.  Staff were aware of safeguarding procedures, could describe what they would do if they thought somebody was being mistreated and said that management  acted appropriately to any concerns brought to their attention.   There were sufficient staff on duty to meet the needs of people who used the service. Staff were available to  provide support with visits out in the community. We found that safe recruitment and selection procedures  were in place and appropriate checks had been undertaken before staff started work.     Appropriate checks of the building and maintenance systems were undertaken to ensure health and safety.  Risks to people's safety had been assessed by staff and records of these assessments had been reviewed.   Risk assessments had been personalised to each individual and covered areas such as  health, falls, moving  and handling and the use of equipment. This enabled staff to have the guidance they needed to help people to remain safe.    Appropriate systems were in place for the management of medicines so that people received their  medicines safely.    Staff had been trained and had the skills and knowledge to provide support to the people they cared for.   Staff understood the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) and the Deprivation of Liberty  Safeguards, which meant they were working within the law to support people who may lack capacity to  make their own decisions.   People were provided with a choice of healthy food and drinks, which helped to ensure that their nutritional  needs were met.    People were supported to maintain good health and had access to healthcare professionals and services.   People were supported and encouraged to have regular health checks and were accompanied by staff to  hospital appointments.   The registered provider had a system in place for responding to people's concerns and complaints. People  told us they knew how to complain and felt confident that staff would respond and take action to support  them.  People we spoke with did not raise any complaints or concerns about the service.  3 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was safe.  People told us they felt safe.  Staff were aware of the different  types of abuse and knew how to recognise and respond to abuse correctly.  There were sufficient skilled and experienced staff on duty to  meet people's needs.  Robust recruitment procedures were in  place.    Effective systems were in place for the management and  administration of medicines. Checks of the building and  maintenance systems were undertaken, which ensured people's  health and safety was protected.  	  The service was effective.   Staff had the knowledge and skills to support people who used  the service. They were able to update their skills through regular  training.  Staff had received regular supervision and an annual  appraisal.  Staff had an understanding of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards  People were provided with a choice of nutritious food.  People  were weighed on a regular basis and nutritional screening took  place.  People were supported to maintain good health and had access  to healthcare professionals and services.  	  This service was extremely caring   People who used the service and their relatives consistently said  staff supported them with care and compassion and got to know people exceptionally well.  The registered manager and staff  were committed to achieving excellence in the provision of care.    4 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  Good    Good    Outstanding    Outstanding    Outstanding    People were treated with respect and their independence,  privacy and dignity were promoted. People and relatives were  included in making decisions about their care.   End of life care was exemplary, staff worked closely with the  community nursing team to ensure people and their families  were well supported and cared for.  	  The service was very responsive.  People consistently received person centred care.  People who  used the service and relatives were involved in decisions about  their care and support needs.  People were provided with numerous opportunities to take part  in a varied range of stimulating activities of their choice inside  and outside the service.    People did not raise any concerns about the service they  received.  The registered provider had a system in place in which  complaints could be made.  	  The service was extremely well led.  People received a reliable, well organised service and expressed  a high level of satisfaction with the standard of their care.    Staff were supported by the registered manager and felt able to  have open and transparent discussions with them through  supervision and staff meetings.   There was an established management team that had a track  record of putting people at the heart of the service, involving  them meaningfully in decisions about how the service was run.  5 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017     Nunthorpe Oaks  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  We inspected Nunthorpe Oaks on 21 February and 7 March 2017.  The first day of the inspection was  unannounced, which meant that the staff and registered provider did not know we would be visiting.  We  informed the registered provider of our visit on 7 March 2017.  The inspection team consisted of one adult  social care inspector and an Expert by Experience.  An Expert by Experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service.  In addition a representative  from the National Audit Office accompanied us on the first day of the inspection.  The National Audit Office  attended the inspection as they wanted to understand our inspection processes as part of an audit they are  currently undertaking on the Care Quality Commission.  Before the inspection we reviewed all the information we held about the service. The registered provider  had completed a provider information return (PIR).  This is a form that asks the registered provider to give  some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to make.  We used the Short Observational Framework for Inspection (SOFI) during this inspection. SOFI is a way of  observing care to help us understand the experience of people who could not talk with us.    We sat in communal areas and observed how staff interacted with people. We spoke with 14 people who  used the service and nine relatives.  In addition, we received information via e-mail from two relatives after  our visit.  We also spoke with a retired councillor who visited the service on a weekly basis to spend time  with people who used the service.  We looked around communal areas of the home and some bedrooms.  During the visit we spoke with the registered manager, deputy manager, trainee unit manager, handy lady,  handy man, activity co-ordinator and two care assistants.  We also contacted commissioners of the service  and health professionals who visited the service to seek their views.  Their comments can be read in the  main body of this report.   6 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  We reviewed a range of records.  This included four people's care records, including care planning  documentation and medicine records.  We also looked at staff files, including staff recruitment and training  records, records relating to the management of the home and a variety of policies and procedures  developed and implemented by the registered provider.  7 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017   	  Good  	"   People and their relatives told us they felt Nunthorpe Oaks was a safe place to live. One person said, ""I didn't feel safe before I moved in here and only slept for about four hours a night, but now I sleep 12 hours a night."" Another person said, ""The staff are always there to provide you with reassurance should you need it and that definitely makes me feel safe.""  Another person said, ""I'm as settled as much as anywhere, the staff are  wonderful triers, I needed 24 hour care so the security is important.""  A relative said, ""We have peace of mind  knowing [relative] is so well cared for.""    During our discussions with staff they were able to tell us about different types of abuse.  Staff were aware of  action they should take if abuse was suspected and were able to describe how they ensured the welfare of  vulnerable people was protected through the organisation's whistle blowing and safeguarding procedures.   The registered manager and staff told us abuse and safeguarding was discussed with staff on a regular basis  during supervision and staff meetings.  The registered manager told us, ""[Name of two staff members] are  safeguarding champions.  They work with seniors and other staff and talk about safeguarding.  They act on  any issues before they get bigger to keep people safe.""  Staff told us that they had received safeguarding training at induction and every year thereafter.  Records  were available to confirm staff had received safeguarding training within the last 12 months.  Staff told us  that they felt confident in whistleblowing (telling someone) if they had any worries.    Risks to people's safety had been assessed by staff and records of these assessments had been reviewed.  Risk assessments had been personalised to each individual and covered areas such as health, falls, moving  and handling and the use of equipment. This enabled staff to have the guidance they needed to help people to keep safe.  Staff at the service took a positive approach to risk taking.  For example, one relative told us  that although the person who used the service had poor eye sight staff had encouraged and supported a  person to walk around the enclosed garden as they liked to be outdoors.  The relative told us, ""I presume  [relative] feels safe here as it's a community.  [Relative] walks around the gardens about 12 times a day and  this helps with [relative's] wellbeing.""   Recruitment procedures were thorough and all necessary checks were made before new staff commenced  employment. For example, obtaining references and Disclosure and Barring Service checks (DBS). These  were carried out before potential staff were employed to confirm that they were of suitable character to  work with vulnerable people.   Through our observations and discussions with people, relatives and staff members, we found there were  enough staff with the right experience and training to meet the needs of the people who used the service.   The registered manager told us there were nine staff on duty during the day and overnight there were five  staff on duty.  We looked at duty rotas, which confirmed this and saw that this was a mixture of care  assistants and senior care assistants.  We spoke with people who used the service about the amount of staff  on duty.  One person said, ""There always seems to be one of them [staff] around if you need help.""  Another  person said, ""I'm never kept waiting when I need them [staff].""  From our observations we saw when people   8 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  needed help staff were visible and available to provide the help and support.    We looked at records which confirmed that checks of the building and equipment were carried out to ensure health and safety was maintained.  We saw documentation and certificates to show that relevant checks  had been carried out on the gas safety, fire extinguishers and the fire alarm.  We saw certificates to confirm  that portable appliance testing (PAT) had been undertaken and was up to date.  PAT is the term used to  describe the examination of electrical appliances and equipment to ensure they are safe to use. This  showed that the registered provider had developed appropriate maintenance systems to protect people  who used the service against the risks of unsafe or unsuitable premises and equipment.  We also saw that personal emergency evacuation plans (PEEP's) were in place for each of the people who  used the service. PEEP's provide staff with information about how they can ensure an individual's safe  evacuation from the premises in the event of an emergency. Records showed that regular evacuation  practices had been undertaken.  Records were available to confirm that the fire alarm was tested on a  weekly basis to make sure it was in working order.    Arrangements were in place for managing accidents and incidents and preventing the risk of reoccurrence.   We saw that regular analysis was undertaken on all accidents and incidents in order to identify any patterns  or trends and to put measures put in place to avoid re-occurrence.    The registered provider had systems and processes in place for the safe management of medicines. Staff  were trained and had their competency to administer medicines checked on a regular basis. Medicine  administration records (MAR's) that we looked at were completed correctly with no gaps or anomalies. We  asked what information was available to support staff when handling medicines to be given 'as required'.   We saw that written guidance was kept to help make sure they were given appropriately and in a consistent  way.  Arrangements were in place for the safe and secure storage of people's medicines.  Medicine storage was  neat and tidy which made it easy to find people's medicines.  Room temperatures were monitored daily to  ensure that medicines were stored within the recommended temperature ranges.  9 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017   "	  Good  	"   People who used the service told us staff provided a good quality of care.  One person said, ""I have improved since I moved in here.  I was six stone and now I am eating much better I have gone up to seven stone.  I feel  much better in myself.""  Another person said, ""I've been here since September.  I made the choice to come  here [Nunthorpe Oaks] and I haven't regretted it.""  Staff were aware of their roles and responsibilities and had the skills, knowledge and experience to support  people who used the service.  We saw that staff had undertaken training considered to be mandatory by the  service. This included: safeguarding vulnerable adults, fire, health and safety, nutrition, medicines  administration and first aid.  In addition staff had completed other training specific to their role such as end  of life care and dementia.  Staff said the quality of the training was very good.  The activity co-ordinator told  us how pleased they were to have done training in end of life care as this had helped them when spending  time with people who were receiving palliative care.  They also said, ""The company are really investing in me and I have just been enrolled on a first aid course.""  Another staff member told us how the registered  provider invested in good training and also listened to any individual requests for training.  They said, ""I have worked here for three years now and have done loads of training.  I have started to do an 'Education in  Training' course which I really wanted to do.  Embrace has paid for this training for me.  They are very willing  to support you in courses of your choice.""  The registered manager had also organised for representatives from the Parkinson's Society and a nurse  who specialised in motor neurone disease to come into the service to provide training to staff.  Staff told us  they had found this training to be very beneficial.  Staff told us they felt well supported and that they had received supervision and an annual appraisal.   Supervision is a process, usually a meeting, by which an organisation provide guidance and support to staff. We saw records to confirm that supervision and appraisals had taken place.  A staff member we spoke with  said, ""Our supervision is very good.  [Name of registered manager] does my supervision and it is very  worthwhile.  If I am struggling with anything I can talk to [name of registered manager] about it."" Induction  processes were available to support newly recruited staff. This included reviewing the service's policies and  procedures and shadowing more experienced staff.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves.  The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best  interests and legally authorised under the MCA.  The application procedures for this in care homes and  hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. At the time of the inspection five   10 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  people were subject to DoLS authorisations with a further eight awaiting authorisation. People subject to  DoLS had this clearly recorded in their care records and the service maintained a good audit of people  subject to a DoLS so they knew when they were due to expire and reassessment was needed.  Where  relevant, people had been supported to access specialist dementia advocates and had their rights upheld.  When people were deprived of their liberty we saw that staff used the least restrictive options available.  For  example, some people were unable to leave the service independently, however people were encouraged  and supported to go out into the garden area.  We saw that staff directed people out into the garden to  enjoy the fresh air and plants.  We saw that people enjoyed being out in the garden and had the freedom to  walk around.  Mental capacity assessments were available in care records, which identified that people lacked capacity to  be involved in their care planning process and decisions surrounding their care.  We saw that staff, family  and other professionals were involved in making best interest decisions where this was the case.   We looked at the menu plan, which provided people with choice.  Staff were able to tell us about particular  individuals, how they catered for them, and how they fortified food for people who needed extra  nourishment.  Fortified food is when meals and snacks are made more nourishing and have more calories  by adding ingredients such as butter, double cream, cheese and sugar.  This meant that people were  supported to maintain their nutrition.  People told us they liked the food.  One person said, ""The food is so  good.  We get good nutritious food with vitamins.""  Another person said, ""We get protein with every meal.   We certainly eat well and get vegetables galore.""  Staff were knowledgeable about specific food intolerances and made adjustment in the way food was  cooked to accommodate people's needs.  One person said, ""I was a wreck when I came.  I was six stones and then I was diagnosed as a [food intolerance].  I was the first person they had had with this; I caused them  some problems (person who used the service joked about this). The cook discusses my menus every few  weeks. [The cook] got interested in my special diet.  [The cook] was making me special bread and cakes, I  was piling on the weight, I had to ask [the cook] to make less.""  The registered manager told us that all people who used the service had undergone nutritional screening to  identify if they were malnourished, at risk of malnutrition or obesity.  The service used the Malnutrition  Universal Screening Tool (MUST) to assess people.  This is an objective screening tool to identify adults who  are at risk of being malnourished.  As part of this screening people were weighed at regular intervals.   We saw records to confirm that people had received visits from the dentist, optician, chiropodist, dietician  and their doctor in order to maintain their general health and wellbeing.  Staff told us they had good  relationships with the doctors who visited people.  Staff told us the doctors would visit at any time if needed. People were accompanied to hospital appointments by staff, however if relatives preferred to support the  person they were able to do so.  Relatives told us staff acted quickly when people became unwell and kept  them up to date with the outcome of any doctor or hospital visits.  One relative said, ""They [staff] responded  very quickly to an emergency situation when [relative] was having a stroke.  They called the ambulance  immediately.""  We contacted the district nursing service as part of the inspection to ask for their views.  They wrote and told  us, 'For the past 3 years, I have been part of a small team of community nurses involved in caring for the  residents of Nunthorpe Oaks requiring nursing intervention, and visit the care home on a regular basis.   During this time, I have found that a positive working relationship has developed between the care home  staff and the nursing team.  Carers never hesitate to ask for professional advice and are comfortable to ask if   11 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  unsure, especially regarding pressure area care and skin integrity.  This partnership ensures that safe,  effective care can be provided, as concerns are reported in a timely manner.  Recommendations and  guidance, such as positional changes and nutritional intake are always acted on promptly, and staff appear  to take on any board advice given.  For example - wound care and the extra nutrition required, staff ensure  residents who have difficulty eating or drinking are given extra attention and encouraged to eat and drink at  every available opportunity, not just mealtimes.  Nunthorpe Oaks is purpose built with 56 en-suite rooms, which consist of a toilet and hand wash basin.  There are four lounge areas and landscaped gardens which were easily accessible.  People's bedrooms were very personalised with possessions, pictures and photographs that were important to them.  All areas of the  service were well maintained.  12 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People, relatives and professionals praised staff and told us about the excellent care provided at Nunthorpe  Oaks.  One person made the thumbs up sign and said, ""This place is tip top.""  Another person said, ""The staff are wonderful and very, very caring.""  Another person said, ""Wonderful, wonderful and wonderful."" A relative  said, ""My [relative] has just moved in and [relative] couldn't be happier.  It's the ambience and the staff work  so hard.  They are absolutely smashing.""   The registered manager had received a recent compliment from a relative, which they shared with us.  This  read, 'From the very beginning [relative] tells us [relative] has been treated royally.  In [relative's] own words  'I couldn't be better looked after; I have my cleaning and laundry done, food provided,  everything I need; I  couldn't have coped on my own and I couldn't be in a better place'.  At first, being used to his own company  [relative] tended to stay in his room  (which incidentally is fantastic - large enough for us to have installed  some of [relative's] own furniture, knick-knacks, photos and pictures, and with [relative's] own en-suite toilet and wash basin, which with [relative's] very limited mobility is an absolute boon) but with the gentle  encouragement and persuasion of yourself and staff [relative] now enjoys many of the activities provided.  I  often have to ring [relative] about 3 times because [relative's] not in [relative's] room; then I remember 'oh,  it's Monday, [relative] will be at his carpet bowls'.....etc.  [Relative] also only (last week we discovered) joined  your 'Ooomph' Class [name of activity co-ordinator], which is a fantastic achievement.  [Relative] was a  regular churchgoer so is delighted that a church service is held regularly which [relative] always attends, and tells me proudly that 'they enjoy my singing'. And of course with all the extra entertainment provided  [relative] always has the choice of company or solitude depending on how [relative] is feeling.   When  [relative] is in his room I know that staff regularly pop their heads round the door to make sure [relative's]  OK, even when we are visiting.  Their kindness is unbelievable.""  Another relative wrote to us and said, 'I cannot thank the staff enough for their kindness and exceptional  care my precious [relative] is receiving. Their [staff] patience is tireless they are so gentle and understanding  of [relative's] needs and also supporting my sister when she visits.'  The service had a strong, visible person centred culture and was exceptional at helping people to express  their views.  One person who used the service was the chairman of the 'residents committee'.  This person  chaired regular meetings and obtained people's views on the care and service provided. People told us they  had a voice and were continually asked for their opinion and were involved in making decisions.  At a  meeting in January 2017 people were asked for their opinions on cleaning and maintenance, food and  activities.  One person raised concern that the ground was rough under foot outside where they smoked.   They described the seating in this area as 'terrible'.  The chairman told us they spoke with the registered  manager and the area was upgraded.    During the inspection we spent time observing interactions between staff and people who used the service.   There was a calm and relaxed atmosphere, we saw staff interacting with people in a very caring and friendly  way, promoting independence, dignity and choice at all times.  We heard staff speaking to people about  topics that interested them, or they had experienced in their lives.  One staff member spoke to a person   13 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  about their family.  They spoke with another person about cooking and baking.  People smiled and clearly  enjoyed this conversation.  We heard another staff member compliment a person on the way they were  dressed and their hair, we saw the person smile as they were complimented.  These examples showed that  staff were knowledgeable about each individual and were able to use this knowledge to have meaningful  interactions with people in a very caring way.  Staff demonstrated a kind and caring approach with all of the people they supported.  We saw staff actively  listened to what people had to say and took time to help people feel valued and important. When speaking  with people we saw that staff got down to the level of the person so they did not appear intimidating and to  enable eye contact with the person. On one occasion we saw a staff member touching the hand of a person  who used the service, we saw from the person's facial expressions that this brought about comfort and  reassurance.  On another occasion a staff member was painting the nails of a person who used the service.   The person who used the service put their head towards the staff member and the staff member responded. We could see that this provided the person with happiness.  The registered manager told us they and the staff team tried to replicate a family environment and this was  supported by what relatives had written about the home.  One relative wrote, 'We would like to thank you all so much for the wonderful Christmas Day at the 'Oaks'. Being [relative's] first Christmas at the 'Oaks' we  wanted it to be like any other Christmas Day we shared, and with your help and generosity we were able to  do just that.  The three course Christmas lunch was superb, being able to personalise the lunch table was a  big help so that [relative] had [relative's] familiarities – and [relative's] favourite tipple!!! The kindness you  normally show was outdone on Christmas Day.  Everyone was wonderful.' The registered manager showed  us photographs they had taken of the person who used the service and their relatives spending Christmas  day at the service.   People were encouraged to maintain their role in family life. Staff were passionate about supporting people  to maintain important relationships within their own family. The deputy manager told us how they had  supported two people who used the service to attend a family wedding.  And this included returning to the  home for a 'freshen up' before returning to continue with the celebrations.  On another occasion staff stayed with a person who used the service whilst they were in hospital until their  family were able to get home from their holiday.  They wrote, 'I have to say the response of your team to  [person who used the service] last week when [relative] became very sick was fantastic - it was really heart- warming. The support and care and devotion of [names of staff] in particular was as though it was a member of their own  family – it provided [relative] and I with great comfort and support and we are extremely  grateful to have such exceptional people looking after [relative]. I look forward to hopefully seeing them this  weekend when I come and visit.'  One person who used the service told us how all of their family had taken over the garden room for a private  party to celebrate their 90th birthday.  They told us how the person and their family had really appreciated  this opportunity.    Another compliment the staff received was, '[Name of person who used the service] was treated with dignity  and respect from the minute [relative] moved in until [relative] died. As we visited daily we were able to  observe the relentless hard work and dedication of each member of staff whether senior staff, carers,  laundry, kitchen staff, cleaners and handymen. We found them diligent and so caring, treating each person  as an individual.  In fact I cannot praise them highly enough.'  Recently staff helped to arrange the funeral of a person whose only living relative lived too far away and they  14 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  were unable to attend.  Staff helped to alleviate the pressure by liaising with the relative, providing support  and organising for the person to have a fitting send off by leaving from the service.  Staff gathered outside of  the home to pay their respects and photographs were taken and sent to the relative.  Managers and staff at all levels were committed to working in a person-centred way. The service had many  dignity champions.  The registered manager had encouraged staff in different roles to enrol and become a  dignity champion.  They said, ""Dignity is very individual to people, what is important to one is different to  another person.""  The registered manager told us they were actively involved in the national Dignity in Care  campaign, which aims to change the culture of health and social care services improving the quality of care  and the experience of people using services. The registered manager strove continually to develop the  approach of the staff team, motivating and inspiring them to continue offering kind, compassionate care.   The expectation of a caring and person-centred approach to people was made clear to staff at induction,  and was reinforced through ongoing supervision and training.  The registered manager told us dignity was  on the agenda at every meeting to re-enforce the 10 dignity points all people who used the service and staff  were aware of.  One of the 10 points of dignity was to engage with family members and relatives confirmed  staff at the service communicated with them exceptionally well.  One relative said, ""We [relatives]  communicate with the carers a lot, we [relatives and staff] work as a team, we don't want to take over we  consult each other.""  Another point of the 10 dignity do's was to provide people with choice.  A person who  used the service told us how staff accommodated this by giving them their medicines earlier than others as  they liked to go to bed early.  This showed that the staff team were committed to delivering a service that  had compassion and respect for people.   Each year people who used the service and staff celebrated Dignity Action Day.  This provided an  opportunity for people in health and social care to come together to uphold people's rights to dignity and  provide a memorable experience for people.  The activity co-ordinator told us that this year people who  used the service, staff and relatives had celebrated with a cream tea.   It was clear from speaking with the registered manager and staff and from looking at records the registered  provider was committed to achieving excellence in the provision of care.    The registered manager and staff showed concern for people's wellbeing. It was evident from discussion  that all staff knew people well, including their personal history, preferences, likes and dislikes.  One relative  said, ""I can't believe how well [relative] has settled.  The staff do a fantastic job.  [Relative] has been given a  new lease of life.  After a couple of weeks [relative's] not just more animated but more mobile, which has  made a positive impact on [relative's] wellbeing."" Staff told us they enjoyed supporting people.  One staff  member said, ""This is an amazing place to work.  [Name of deputy manager] always says if the residents are  happy then I am happy.""  We saw that people had free movement around the service and could choose where to sit and spend their  recreational time. We saw that people were able to go to their rooms at any time during the day to spend  time on their own.  This helped to ensure that people received care and support in the way that they wanted  to.    At the time of the inspection people who used the service did not require an advocate.  An advocate is a  person who works with people or a group of people who may need support and encouragement to exercise  their rights.  The registered manager was aware of the process to follow should an advocate be needed.  There was no-one receiving end of life care at the time of the inspection. However, the registered manager   15 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  talked to us about end of life care planning, pain relief and how the district nursing service visited to support  people and staff.  We contacted the district nursing service as part of the inspection to ask for their views.   They wrote and told us, ""End of life care in the home is exemplary, staff work closely with the community  nursing team to ensure residents and their family are treated with dignity and respect, and that their  individual preferences are considered at all times.   We were shown many compliments from families thanking the registered manager and staff for their care  and support after people had died.  We read a compliment about the deputy manager.  It said, 'You couldn't  have done more if it was one of your own family.  You have shown much extra ordinary care and love.'  16 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People who used the service and relatives constantly praised the staff, care and service provided.  One  person said, ""I have come to realise that company is more important than loneliness and I certainly have  company here.""  Another person said, ""I couldn't be happier.  All the staff generate so much fun and  laughter.""  A relative we spoke with said, ""It's a marvellous place with staff who really know what they are  doing and really care.""  During the inspection we received information from a general practioner who wrote, 'I have been attending  Nunthorpe Oaks as a clinician, many of my patients are residents and have nursing needs cared for at this  home.  I have always found the standard of care to be excellent, communication with staff has been  informative and helpful and they have always shown the utmost care and respect to patients and  willingness to help clinicians seeing their patients.  The registered manager showed us a recent compliment they had received.  This read, 'You can't begin to  imagine what a huge relief it is to know that [relative] is so happy and well looked after.  We always leave  after a visit feeling light hearted and confident that [relative] is in the very best place, as we did yesterday.   We had many laughs with [relative] and [relative's] carers and it was lovely to see [relative] so animated.   Although [relative's] been diagnosed with Alzheimer's I'm sure that all the company and mind stimulation  [relative] receives has kept [relative's] disease at bay, and whilst I know this is a progressive illness, we have  seen a definite improvement in [relative] since he has been a resident with you.'  The registered manager told us the service employed two part time activity co-ordinators who organised  and arranged activities and outings for people who used the service.  They told us one of the activity co- ordinators spent more of their time working with people on a one to one basis, whilst the other led the  group activities. We spoke with one of the activity co-ordinators who presented as being extremely  enthusiastic and passionate about what they did.  The activity co-ordinator told us, ""I am pretty proud of the activities here.  I enjoy seeing them [people who used the service] sharing joyful moments.  I choose to do  activities in the back lounge so people can come to join in.  It's not forced on people.  Meaningful activities  make happy residents.""  All staff told us people who used the service and Nunthorpe Oaks were very much part of the community,  with local groups often visiting. The activity co-ordinator told us how a local knitting group visited the  service on a Wednesday to spend time with people who used the service.  They told us that initially this  group consisted of about five visitors who were knitters and a handful of people who used the service.  They  told us how this group had grown considerably and how it wasn't just a knitting group it had become a 'knit  and natter' so to include more people.  The 'knit and natter' group had really taken off and proved to be very popular.  A retired local councillor  worked alongside the home's activity co-ordinator to run the group.  The retired local councillor told us how  they came along with knitting needles and wool at the ready and how the service prepared a drinks trolley  for all.  One person said, ""I don't knit but I certainly like to natter.""  A relative said, ""This group has had a   17 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  fantastic impact on [relative].  [Relative] is more sociable, mixing with people and has made friends.""  The  retired councillor told us this group enabled the community to come together, socialise and enhanced  people's stay.  They also said, ""In the community people have a positive image of the 'Oaks'.  If I had to be  anywhere I would be happy to be here.  This place feels alive.""  People's spiritual needs were acknowledged and provided for.  There were links with local churches and  some people who used the service had retained their connection with their churches.  Children and teachers from local schools visited the service.  At Christmas the nursery children wrote cards for all people who used  the service.  Some people who used the service had visited the local senior school for tea and  entertainment.  We were told that the service is to reciprocate with people who used the service hosting an  event and invite the children to Nunthorpe Oaks as a thank you.  One person said, ""It is so lovely when the  children come to visit.  I love to hear them sing.  It gives you a lovely warm feeling inside.""  The service has a minibus, which is wheelchair accessible and was provided last year by the registered  provider.  People had enjoyed a recent trip to Dorman's Museum.   Activities were tailored to people's individual interests and abilities.  When people first moved into  Nunthorpe Oaks, staff at the service completed a detailed history of the person and this included finding out about their interests and hobbies.  The activity co-ordinator told us they spoke with people when they first  moved to find out their individual interests to ensure that activities were person centred.  People confirmed  they were consulted on the activities and outings taking place and it was their choice if they participated or  didn't participate. People who used the service had an individual activities support plan which was reviewed and updated on a regular basis.   The chairman of the residents committee told us how they were heavily involved in activities within the  service.  They told us how they led groups in crosswords, dominoes and quizzes and how they were  extremely popular.  They also told us they and the registered manager ran a history group in the service.   They said, ""I help [registered manager], we run a local history session three times a year, I research the old  photos we use.  The residents love it.""  The registered manager told us how they got representatives from a  local history group to come in and give talks to people.  One person said, ""I love all the activities, but I do  love history and enjoy listening to people and learning something new.""  Relatives were also involved in leading activities.  The relative of one person played the piano for people and there was singing.  Another relative told us, ""She [the activity co-ordinator] is a good seller and draws people in.  I'm coming in next week to do baking with residents.""  The relative told us how their career had been in  catering and how the activity co-ordinator was quick to draw on everyone's skills to ensure variety and  stimulation.    Meaningful activity was seen to be important.  We attended the regular bowling session in the garden room,  which proved to be very popular.  One person who had a visual impairment told us, ""It's not deadly serious  it's a laugh.""  This person was assisted to bowl with verbal prompts from the activity co-ordinator.  There  was a sense of excitement in the room and people were competitive.  One person was struggling with the  bowling ball and was given a smaller lighter one by the activity co-ordinator.  The activity co-ordinator told  us the bowling balls had been donated by the local bowls club.  The registered manager told us staff had been trained to provide a programme of exercise activity, fun and  mental stimulation to people who used the service.  The activity co-ordinator told us how this was  particularly beneficial to older people living with a dementia as it provided activity, exercise and  reminiscence to familiar music.  This involved the use of sensory props such as pom-poms.  We watched this  18 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  exercise activity and saw that people thoroughly enjoyed this.  The staff member leading the activity  encouraged people to participate.  People told us this exercise had made a real difference to them. One  person told us how the swelling in their legs had reduced and another person told us how their mobility had  increased.  One person said, ""This is a fantastic and enjoyable way of exercising you could see how much fun we had.""  Another person said, ""I so look forward to these sessions.  We [people and staff] have a giggle but  we also benefit by keeping fit and healthier.  I certainly feel better in myself.""  The activity co-ordinator told us they had researched meaningful activities for people living with a dementia. They showed us the 'Twiddlemuffs', which were knitted woollen muffs with items such as ribbons, large  buttons or textured fabrics attached that people living with a dementia can twiddle in their hands. People  living with a dementia often have restless hands and like something to keep them occupied.  People also did large chunky jigsaws and liked to draw and paint.  The activity co-ordinator would often spend time with  people on a one to one basis reading or taking people out into the local community.  The activity co- ordinator told us how they chatted and reminisced with people.  They told us how people liked to have their  nails painted and be pampered.     We saw people consistently received person centred care.  This meant the service put people at the centre of all decisions whilst working alongside other professionals to achieve the best possible outcome.  During  discussion staff told us how they carefully considered what people wanted, their values, family, lifestyle and  treating the person as an individual.  During our visit we reviewed the care records of four people.  We saw  people's needs had been individually assessed and plans of care drawn up. The care plans we looked at  included people's personal preferences, likes and dislikes.  For example, the care plan for one person  detailed the type of soap they liked to use and that it was important to them that they wore make up.  People and relatives told us they had been involved in making decisions about care and support and  developing the care plans.  Care plans provided consistent and up to date information about each  individual.    During the inspection we spoke with staff who were extremely knowledgeable about the care that people  received.  People who used the service, staff and relatives told us how staff supported people to plan all  aspects of their life.  Staff were responsive to the needs of people who used the service.    We were shown a copy of the complaints procedure. The procedure gave people timescales for action and  who in the organisation to contact.  We spoke with people who used the service and relatives who told us  that if they were unhappy they would not hesitate in speaking with the registered manager or staff.  They  told us they were listened to and that they felt confident in raising any concerns with the staff.  One person  we spoke with said, ""We [people who used the service] are encouraged to say if we are unhappy about  something.""  People told us that having a person who used the service as a chairman of their residents  committee also encouraged people to share their views.  People told us any small grumbles were acted  upon quickly.   There was a positive, open, transparent culture about complaints and concerns.  Discussion with the  registered manager confirmed that any concerns or complaints were taken seriously.  We looked at records  which indicated that the two complaints received since our last inspection had been dealt with promptly  and appropriately.  We saw that the service kept a record of compliments.  19 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service was exceptionally well-led. It had an experienced and skilled registered manager in post, which  provided stable and consistent leadership. This was supported by what people and relatives told us. One  person said, ""[Registered manager] is always there if you need her.""  One relative said, ""This is a fabulous  place with an incredible staff team and excellent leadership.""  Another relative had written to the registered  manager to express their appreciation 'As a sailor myself I would describe Nunthorpe Oaks as a very well run  ship, with an excellent Captain and crew - so keep it up 'my hearties.'  A visitor said, ""The leadership is  excellent.  [Name of registered manager] clearly runs a tight ship.""  Visiting health professionals confirmed  the registered manager was extremely effective in their role.  There was a clear management structure in place at the service. The registered manager was supported by a regional manager and two deputy managers and each member of the management team played an  effective part in the running of the service. The registered manager recognised individual skills of staff and  utilised these through effective delegation.  The registered manager empowered staff by sharing  responsibilities whilst monitoring their performance.  The management team worked extremely hard to  ensure people who used the service and relatives were involved in how the service developed and delivered  care.  The service had received many compliments. We were shown a recent letter that had been sent to the  registered manager.  This said, '[Name of registered manager], what an amazing job you have done in  turning round the Oaks.  It has meant we felt confident that [relative] was getting all the care, support and  love [relative] needed in [relative's] final years.  You've shown great leadership and management skills as  well as just knowing how to do things 'right'.  We're so fortunate that [relative] benefited from all of that.'   The registered manager led by example and modelled excellent practice to staff.  For example, throughout  the inspection if a person needed support or assistance the registered manager prioritised the person above everything else. People, relatives and staff told us this was the registered manager's usual practice and this  ethos was carried out throughout the service.  The registered manager told us they were proud of the  service, staff and care that was delivered.  The registered manager told us, ""I try to make a difference to  people's lives.  I try and spread happiness.  I lead by example and treat everyone the same whatever their  age, disability or religion.  I wake up on a morning and can't wait to come to work.  I have been looking  forward to you [the Care Quality Commission] coming in so that I can show you what a good job we do.""  Staff told us that they felt valued and supported by the registered manager.  One staff member said, ""I  absolutely love my job.  [Name of registered manager] is fantastic.  With [name of registered manager and  name of the two deputy managers] we have excellent leadership and great team work.""   The registered manager and staff told us they also felt valued by the registered provider.  The registered  manager said, ""I feel valued by the company.  They are there if I need anything.  I asked for a minibus and I  got it.""  A staff member said, ""Embrace invest in training and their staff.  All the additional training I have  asked for I have got.  Because of this we [staff and service] are outstanding.  We were good but we have gone  20 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  all out to be even better.""  The registered manager and all of the staff were constantly looking for new experiences for people so that  they benefitted from lives that were more fulfilled. They had built excellent links with the community.  Clergy  from local places of worship visited the service regularly.  A local knitting group visited the service on a  weekly basis and people and relatives described this as invaluable as it enabled people to maintain contact  with local people.  One person who used the service was soon to be discharged and we were told that the  local knitting group were to continue to visit the person in their own home.  Local schools visited the service  and people visited the schools.  The service received welcome donations such as bowling balls that were  donated by the local bowls club.  One person who used the service told us being part of the community was  very important to them and this hadn't changed when they moved into Nunthorpe Oaks.  They said, ""I used  to live over the road so when I go to the shop I see all of my neighbours and wave to them.""  The registered manager told us when one person who used the service moved in, they had been diagnosed  with a food intolerance.  The registered manager thought there was no better person to provide training to  staff than them.  This person was pleased to be asked to provide such training.  Staff told us the training was  ""Great and very informative."" The person told us the registered manager had given training certificates out  to those staff who had attended.  The registered manager and staff had signed up as Dementia Friends.  Dementia Friends is an Alzheimer's  Society initiative that aims to give people a better understanding of dementia.  The registered manager and  staff had created an informative notice board with leaflets and information on dementia for everyone to  read.  The registered manager told us they were to advertise and invite people living with a dementia from  the local community and their families to an event at the service.  They told us this would provide an  opportunity for people who used the service, relatives and people from the local community, to come  together and enjoy each other's company in a safe and supported environment.    The registered manager told us that they had signed up to the Gold Standards Framework.  The Gold  Standards Framework provides training to staff providing end of life care to ensure better lives for people  and recognised standards of care.  As part of this the service had developed a notice board which was full of  information on the training programme and its benefits to people and relatives.  This training will provide  staff with the knowledge and confidence to care for people at the end of their life.  It was clear from discussion that it was the drive and enthusiasm of the registered manager, deputy  managers, staff and activity co-ordinator, that ensured they made a positive difference to people's lives.  The registered manager was extremely keen to involve people and their relatives.  The service had established a  positive and open culture. The management team encouraged people, their relatives and staff to raise  issues of concern with them.    The registered manager encouraged staff to develop their skills and roles and take responsibility for specific  areas such as activities, medicines and safeguarding. Staff confirmed that they were supported to develop  their skills and knowledge to take up these responsibilities and felt a sense of achievement and personal  development. Discussions with the registered manager showed that they felt a sense of personal  achievement seeing staff develop with their assistance and achieve qualifications to improve their career  aspirations.  One staff member told us, ""[Name of registered manager] is so supportive and encouraging.   She will go out of her way to support you in your career development.""  The registered manager told us, ""If  staff want to come to me I will pass on all of my knowledge and give my all to see them develop.""  We saw records which confirmed that regular meetings for people who used the service and relatives took   21 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  place.  These meetings were chaired by a person who used the service who was very passionate about  keeping people informed and encouraging people to share their views and ideas.  We saw that discussions  had taken place about food, activities, Christmas and much more.  One person who used the service said,  ""Our meetings are very important.  They are led by another resident and we are so much involved in decision making and we are always asked for our opinion.  It's very much about us [people who used the service].""   The chairman told us how the meeting addressed people's concerns.  They gave one example of the dinner  plates being cold at Sunday dinner.  They told us that after this was pointed out they spoke with the cook  and the management and this was resolved.    The service had an inclusion folder.  This contained evidence of people's involvement in the service.  The  home had recently been refurbished and new pictures were to be purchased for the wall.  People and staff  made the decision they would like some pictures with meaning and to trigger memories.  A relative who was  also a keen photographer took some photographs of places of interest.  These were shown to people who  used the service at a meeting.  One person who used the service said, ""The photographs were beautiful. We  chose photographs of Fountains Abbey, Roseberry Topping and scenes from Saltburn to display on the  corridor walls.""  We saw people had been involved in choosing the colour of their bedrooms when these had been decorated.  We saw colour swatches and recordings of the choices that had been made.            Records confirmed that staff meetings had taken place on a regular basis.  There were regular meetings with care staff, night staff and kitchen staff.  In addition health and safety meetings took place. Staff told us that  the meetings provided staff with an opportunity to share their views.   We looked at the arrangements in place for quality assurance and governance.  Quality assurance and  governance processes are systems that help registered providers to assess the safety and quality of their  services, ensuring they provide people with a good service and meet appropriate quality standards and legal obligations.  Monitoring of the service was extremely good. The registered manager, deputy managers and  regional manager completed a wide range of audits to maintain people's safety and welfare at the service.  These looked at quality in areas of the service such as infection control, housekeeping, medicines, care  records, the environment and health and safety.  An audit completed by the regional manager in January  2017 identified improvement was needed in the recording of food, fluid and personal hygiene charts for  people who used the service.  These areas identified as needing improvement during the auditing process  were then analysed and incorporated into a detailed action plan.  We saw there was a culture of continuous  learning and improvement.  Records showed that the regional manager visited the service every month to talk to staff and people who  used the service and check on the quality of service provided.  The registered manager told us they,  ""Continually strived to improve all aspects of the home.""  We asked the registered manager about the arrangements for obtaining feedback from people who used the service and their relatives.  They told us that satisfaction surveys were used to gather feedback in April 2016.   The results of the survey showed that everyone was very happy with the care and service received.    The registered manager understood their role and responsibilities, and was able to describe the  notifications they were required to make to the Commission and these had been received where needed.  22 Nunthorpe Oaks Inspection report 24 May 2017  "

The service is a detached house in a residential area of Sittingbourne. There were two  people living at the service when we inspected.  At the last inspection, the service was rated Good. At this inspection we found the service was Outstanding.  There was a registered manager at the service who was supported by a deputy manager. A registered  manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like  registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting  the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service  is run.  People could become anxious and display behaviours which could have a detrimental effect on themselves  and people around them. Without the right support these behaviours would occur frequently. Some people  had previously had experiences which had made them feel unsafe and their lifestyles had been restrictive.  Staff supported people in a way that minimised risks and protected them from harm. People were  supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported people in the least  restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service supported this.    The providers had fully embraced the principles of Positive Behavioural Support (PBS). PBS is recognised in  the UK as the best way of supporting people who display, or are at risk of displaying, behaviour which  challenges.. The providers had resourced and modelled people's care in accordance with current PBS best  practice principles. The provider's philosophy focussed on using PBS alongside person centred planning  (PCP) to enhance people's lives and expand their opportunities.   People were supported by staff who had been recruited safely and staffing levels were based on people's  needs and activities. People were involved in the recruitment process in a variety of ways. The provider had  a comprehensive training and support system which enabled staff to gain the specialist skills needed to fulfil their role. Staff were involved in advocating for people and spoke with pride about what people had  achieved. Staff supported people with kindness and compassion using their knowledge of people to provide frequent gentle interactions that prevented people from becoming anxious or distressed. People had  limited verbal communication skills and staff used a range of communication tools including Makaton and  picture cards to support people to express themselves.  The service had fostered positive working relationships with health and social care professionals which led  to joint working to expand people's communication skills and identify new ways for people to access health  care. People were involved in planning and preparing their own meals and trying a wider range of meals.   People were involved in planning their own care and care plans reflected their needs and wishes. Staff had  the guidance required to meet people's needs and support them through incidents of challenging behaviour  2 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  whilst continuing to develop their independence. People had been supported to consider and record their  wishes for the end of their life. There was a 'no blame' culture throughout the service, which focussed on  opportunities for learning and improvement. Audits of the service were specifically designed to recognise  the specialist nature of the support provided and to establish new ways to monitor the quality of the  support people received.   People were supported to achieve things that had previously been thought of as 'impossible.' For example,  planning a holiday abroad or selecting their own snacks at a local shop. People took part in a variety of  activities and were continually encouraged to try new things. People told us about visiting the local cinema  and theatre with their friends. The PCP team held regular forums where people from all of the provider's  services could meet to give their views and shape the service moving forward. Training courses were  provided for people, alongside practical independent living skills, they could also access courses about  relationships, sexuality and sexual health, keeping safe and bereavement.    The service supported people to build relationships with neighbours and local businesses to promote  understanding and minimise discrimination. Staff understood their responsibilities in relation to keeping  people safe from harm. Risks to the environment were identified and mitigated. People were supported to  have their medicines in the way they preferred by trained and competent staff.  The providers and registered managers provided consistent and positive support to the service. There was a  sense of equality between people and staff in all roles, and a sense of pride in the quality of care people  were receiving and the positive outcomes they had achieved as a result.  3 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  Good    Good    Outstanding    Outstanding    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service remains Good  	  The service remains good.  	  The service was exceptionally caring.  The provider was aware of issues which may impact on the  relationships between people and staff and sought ways to  provide support in a way which minimised the risk of  relationships breaking down.  People were supported by staff who knew them well, understood their needs and who treated them with respect.   People were supported and encouraged to develop their  independence in all areas of their lives.   The service sought innovative and personalised ways to involve  people in planning their care and support.  People were supported to develop, maintain and rebuild  relationships with friends and loved ones.  	  The service was very responsive.  People were at the centre of their support and staff used a variety of tools to ensure that their care met their needs. People's care  was reviewed consistently and adapted when required.  People had access to a variety of activities they enjoyed. People  were given communication tools to indicate their preferred  activity. People were supported to try new things and to  minimise barriers to participation which may occur as a result of  behaviours which can challenge.  4 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  Outstanding    People were supported to raise any concerns in a range of ways.  People were supported to understand the need for an end of life  plan and encouraged to record their wishes.   	  The service was extremely well-led.  There was a clear and consistent culture throughout the service  which focussed on improving the lives and opportunities of  people.   Auditing systems were effective and were developed in a way  which recognised the specialist nature of the service provided.  Staff constantly sought new ways for people to give meaningful  feedback. Staff, relatives and professionals gave feedback which  was analysed shared.  The registered manager and staff continuously sought  opportunities for learning and improvement.   Health care professionals stated that communication and  information sharing by the service was excellent and effective.  5 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018     Aspley House  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  Aspley House is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or personal care  as single package under one contractual agreement. CQC regulates both the premises and the care  provided, and both were looked at during this inspection. This inspection took place on 4 December 2017 and was announced. We gave short notice to give the staff  the opportunity to prepare people for our visit, so that it lessened the disruption our presence may have  caused. The inspection was carried out by two inspectors.  Before the inspection we looked at information the provider sent us in the Provider Information Return. This  is information we require providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to make. We looked at previous inspection  reports and notifications we had received. Notifications are information we receive from the service when  significant events happen, like a serious injury.  During the inspection we spent time with both people who live at the service. We spoke with the registered  manager, deputy manager, person centred planning manager and co-ordinator, the positive behaviour  support co-ordinator and three staff. After the inspection we received feedback from two health and social  care professionals. We looked at two people's care plans and the associated risk assessments and guidance. We looked at a range of other records including three staff recruitment files, the staff induction records,  training and supervision schedules, staff rotas, medicines records and quality assurance surveys and audits.  6 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018   	  Good  	"   The safety of everyone at the service both people and staff was a priority; and systems were effective in  minimising risks.   Staff had received training related to safeguarding and understood their responsibilities in regards to  reporting any concerns. People were supported to develop skills to help them remain safe and to remove  themselves from situations which may present a risk to them. People were supported to build relationships  with neighbours and local businesses to minimise the risk of discrimination and promote acceptance and  understanding. One person took a regular daily walk and often crossed paths with a neighbour walking their dog. After sometime 'nodding' as they passed, staff supported the person to introduce themselves and now  they and the neighbour shake hands and say ""hello"" every day. Other neighbours now say ""hello"" to people  from the service and see them as part of the community.  Risks to people were identified, assessed and plans were implemented to mitigate the risk in the way which  was least restrictive to people. Staff continually assessed and managed low level risks throughout the day  and were clear about signs to be aware of and actions to take to prevent a crisis situation developing. Risks  to the environment were assessed and appropriate action was taken to mitigate any hazards. Regular  checks were undertaken of fire systems, the general environment and infection control. When shortfalls  were identified action was taken quickly to address these and resolve the issue. Staff had guidance about  how to minimise the risks of infection, including using personal protective equipment and specialist bags for specific laundry. The service was clean and free from odour, staff supported people to keep the service clean on a daily basis.   Staffing levels were based on people's assessed needs and there were additional staff who could be  available to support in times of crisis. Staff were recruited safely with checks being completed to ensure they were suitable for their role. People were involved in the recruitment process through the use of pre-prepared questions or involvement in the interview. When staff had limited experience in the care sector, they were  invited to the service to meet people, people gave their feedback and interactions were observed by the  registered manager who then made a decision about their suitability for employment.  People's medicines were managed safely and in the way they preferred. Medicines were administered by  staff who had received training and who had been assessed as competent to do so. When people were  prescribed medicines to have on an 'as and when required' (PRN) basis, there were protocols in place. These gave staff guidance about why the medicine should be offered, how often and the maximum dosage in 24  hours. When people had PRN medicines to help calm them in times of crisis, this was used as a last resort  and the use of these was monitored two weekly by the registered manager and positive behaviour support  (PBS) co-ordinator. People's PRN protocols for pain relief gave staff information about how people with  limited verbal communication would show signs they were in pain.   There was a culture of learning from incidents, which all staff understood and were involved in. This  included reviewing accidents and incidents, offering staff debriefs following incidents and regular   7 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  multidisciplinary meetings between the provider, staff team, PBS team and person centred planning team.  Changes were made to people's support over time as a result of learning and this had resulted in a  measurable reduction in behaviours which can challenge and restrictive practices used at the service.  8 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018   "	  Good  	"   Health professionals told us, ""I am always very impressed with how knowledgeable the staff and  management at Aspley House are about the people they support. Despite their knowledge they are always  keen to ask for advice about enabling people to engage in meaningful activities and managing known risks.""  People's needs were assessed using a holistic assessment tool, prior to them moving into the service. This  supported the registered manager to review if the service could meet people's needs, if the person was  compatible with other people living at the service and if any additional staff training would be required.  The resulting care plan was developed in line with good practice, including guidance provided by the  National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), NHS guidance and the principles of person centred  planning. The positive behaviour support (PBS) team researched NHS guidance on minimising restrictive  practices and identified ways that elements could be implemented in to the service.   People who lack mental capacity to consent to arrangements for necessary care or treatment can only be  deprived of their liberty when this is in their best interests and legally authorised under the Mental Capacity  Act. The procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards  (DoLS). DoLS authorisations were in place and had been updated as required. Capacity assessments had  been completed for people, and staff had tried a variety of ways to enable people to understand and take  part in decisions about their lives. When a person was found to lack the capacity to make a specific decision, meetings had been held to make the decision in their best interest. Information about the person's history,  previous choices and preferences were all taken into account when making decisions. All restrictive  practices in the service were audited monthly by the PBS team and the staff consistently looked for less  restrictive ways to support people.   Staff completed an induction before working independently with people. This included the care certificate,  physical intervention training, training about PBS and person centred planning (PCP). They also shadowed  experienced staff and were supported to get to know people and how they liked to be supported. The  provider had a comprehensive ongoing training programme for staff, this included core subjects such as  safeguarding and fire safety. Staff also completed specialist training specific to the needs of people at the  service. Training in subjects such as PBS and PCP was continually updated during team meetings, clinical  review meetings and interactions with the providers' specialist teams. Staff were supported through team  meetings, supervisions and clinical supervisions if appropriate.   People were supported to be involved in planning their menus and preparing their own meals. One person  had a very limited diet when they moved into the service and staff had worked with them to expand the  foods that they ate to help them eat a balanced diet. New foods were introduced alongside favourites and  the person was encouraged to try a bit of the new food.  People were living with long term health conditions, such as epilepsy. Each person had a health action plan  which gave details about how they should be supported to stay well and what action should be taken if they   9 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  had a seizure. One person's GP recommended they have regular blood tests to monitor the effects of one of  their medicines. The person was reluctant to have their blood taken, the service worked with a local learning disabilities nurse to complete a desensitisation process with the aim of the person accepting a blood test.  Staff worked alongside the nurse to support the person to remain calm during sessions and used their  knowledge of activities the person enjoyed to minimise their distress. The person co-operated well with the  sessions but subsequently refused the blood test. It was then agreed it was in the person's best interest to  have blood tests taken if they were sedated for any other procedure or if there were indicators of an issue.  Staff were proud to tell us that although the person had refused the blood test they did now tolerate having  their blood pressure, temperature and oxygen levels checked.   The design of the service was adapted to meet the needs of the people living there. Each person had access  to their own bathroom which had a bath or a shower as they preferred. The walls were decorated simply in  neutral colours with minimal pictures to prevent people being over stimulated. Furniture and decoration  was secured to minimise the risk of items being thrown by people when they were distressed. People had  access to a secure garden area which was sheltered and quiet.  10 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   A health and social care professional told us, ""The staff at Aspley House clearly put a lot of thought into  every aspect of people's care."" The provider's focus on care encompassed everyone involved with the  service including, people, relatives and staff.   Staff had built strong caring relationships with people. They knew people well and spoke positively about  their personalities and achievements. People led interactions and staff followed their lead whenever  possible. There was a feeling of equality between people and staff, with lots of humour and laughter. One  person chose to play a game of Monopoly with staff and the person centred planning (PCP) co-ordinator.  Everyone could be heard chatting; the person found it very funny when staff had to pay them money and  joked with staff about not cheating. The staff used the exchange of money to encourage the person to count  and increase their awareness of money in a fun way. The provider was aware that supporting people through incidents of challenging behaviour could have an  impact on relationships built between people and staff. In order to minimise the risk of relationships  breaking down, reflective practice was encouraged, with staff being given de-brief sessions and the  opportunity to express their feelings after an incident of challenging behaviour. The PBS team were working  to develop  new training around post crisis support after reviewing new NHS guidance around how to  support staff who have experienced trauma. There were contradictions between the NHS guidance and  NICE guidance so the team were working to devise a way to combine the approaches to give staff the best  support possible. The registered manager told us, ""We know that incidents impact on everyone differently.  We need to find the best way to listen to staff, learn from the incident and support them to continue working with people in a positive way.""  People used a range of ways to communicate with staff, these included Makaton, pictures and keywords.  Staff were working alongside the local speech and language team (SALT) to develop objects of reference for  one person as they had not responded to pictures. People's care plans showed and staff explained to us that some key words people used had multiple meanings. Staff were involved in a piece of work to try and  identify these meanings and how to differentiate between them. When people interacted with staff they  were given staff's full attention and as much time as they needed to communicate effectively. When people  were repetitive in their communication, staff did not become frustrated and continued to respond to people  as if it were the first time they had communicated this. Staff picked up on early signs of people becoming  distressed or anxious and offered them reassurance.  The PCP team worked alongside staff to find innovative ways to involve people in planning their care. This  involved the use of a range of communication tools, meetings and information gathered relating to people's behaviours which could challenge. Care plans were provided in an easy read format when appropriate. Work was being developed with the local SALT and occupational therapy teams to increase staff's awareness of  ways to increase the effectiveness of non-verbal communication. If people did not want to discuss certain  elements of their care, staff used their previous decisions and choices to guide them. For example, one  person was uncomfortable discussing their support relating to managing their behaviours. Staff were aware  they had previously been hurt during physical interventions, despite the interventions being carried out   11 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  correctly. As a result the person felt unsafe when staff placed their hands on them. A decision was made to  use seclusion to support the person to manage their behaviours when they were a risk to themselves or  others. This was successful and the person told staff they were happy with this solution.  People were supported by staff who promoted their independence and encouraged them to develop new  skills. For example, on the day of the inspection one person prepared lunch for themselves, their housemate  and the staff. They took great pride in making the food and presenting it to people. Staff thanked the person  and praised them for doing a good job which made them smile and laugh. People and staff sat together to  eat lunch, it was very relaxed and sociable. People joked with staff and talked about their plans for the next  few days. Later the person offered everyone including the inspector a cup of tea and gave out the drinks to  each person with the support of staff. After lunch one person asked if they could make chocolate cornflake  cakes, staff agreed to this and negotiated with the person that these would be for supper. The person sought out the registered manager to tell them they were making cakes and offered them to come and eat one  when they were finished. The registered manager gave the person praise for all their hard work.  Staff respected people's privacy and dignity. One person chose to spend time in their room; their allocated  staff member remained in the hallway available for support whilst giving the person time on their own. Staff  checked on the person from time to time, reminding them they were available if needed.   People could have visitors whenever they wished and were supported to build relationships with people.  There was regular interaction between people and friends from the provider's other services. One person  told us staff helped them to plan a cinema trip with friends recently. People attended courses run by the  provider to improve their social interaction skills and understanding about 'being a friend.' When people  were interested in having a partner they were supported to consider what this involved and explore their  expectations of a romantic relationship. Staff helped people to find places where they could meet potential  partners, such as local discos or events for people with a learning disability. Some people had seen changes  in their relationships with family members due to them becoming older. Staff had worked with people and  their relatives to establish the best way to help the person understand the changes. They also sought other  ways for the person to connect with family members by having them share photographs of their activities or  being involved in phone calls to loved ones. Where people had lost touch with family and friends the staff  supported them in a sensitive way to reconnect and rebuild relationships. This was done slowly and in a way which minimised the risk of anyone becoming upset.  12 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   People lived active and meaningful lives, they had opportunities to expand their horizons and staff worked  hard to minimise the impact of any behaviours on people's opportunities to try new things. Staff told us,  ""Everything we do is led by the people we support. We want them to have the same choices and  opportunities in life that we have."" A health and social care professional told us, ""I find the service very  proactive, I feel they are aware of their service users' needs and support them in a forward thinking  approach. My experience with Aspley House has always been productive.""  People's support had been developed with them and the people who were important to them. The provider  had in place a multi-disciplinary (MDT) team to support all aspects of people's life and to find innovative  ways for them to express their wishes and identify goals. They had implemented a care pathway which  included systems and processes which were used to support people to reach their potential. Regular MDT  meetings were held, including representatives from all teams the registered manager and the providers.  People's communication was limited so the MDT reviewed data gathered about people's behaviour and  level of participation in activities to monitor the effectiveness of their support plans and make adjustments  as required.  People had a chosen a keyworker, who took a lead role in their care. When people could not communicate  who they would like to be their keyworker this was decided based on their interactions with staff. Each  person also had a mentor; this staff member had additional training in positive behaviour support (PBS) and worked alongside the key worker to monitor the person's activities, interactions and progressions towards  their goals.  People had monthly meetings with a person centred planning (PCP) co-ordinator, their keyworker and  mentor. People had been supported to use communication tools to identify where they would like these  meetings to happen, when and who they wished to invite. Meeting minutes showed these choices had been  respected. Meetings were used to review people's current care, what had changed in the past month and to  identify any goals people may want to work towards. Records showed how people had indicated their  choices to staff.  All information gained through the meetings was recorded in the person's care plan and  used to develop learning objectives. People's goals ranged from small everyday tasks such as making their  own toast to planning a holiday or trip. Each goal was given the same level of importance, a detailed plan  was put in place identifying steps towards the goal and each achievement was celebrated.   People were supported to host their own annual reviews with case managers and loved ones. People used  presentations and photographs of activities they have taken part in over the past year to show people what  they had achieved. Some people chose not to be involved in certain parts of their review when people were  discussing things they perceived as negative such as about their behaviour. Their meeting plan clearly  explained that they found this distressing and would like to be asked to leave the room before people began talking about these subjects. All members of the meeting were reminded of this as part of the meeting's  introductions.    13 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  People had care plans in an accessible format using pictures or Makaton signs to represent their support.  More detailed plans were available for staff to provide them with all the information they needed to support  people to develop new skills and promote independence. Care plans guided staff to more detailed  breakdowns of how to support people with certain activities such as, personal care or supporting people  when they were anxious or agitated. The breakdown gave staff step by step guidance, highlighted any area  of risk and how staff address these. People's care plans included a life history and photographs of people  who were important to them. Staff had an excellent knowledge of people's care plans and understanding of  their needs. Staff followed people's care plans and understood the importance of consistency of support.   Staff told us, ""People can try any activity they like really, we just have to risk assess it and work with them as  a team to find the way it is most likely to be successful. If it doesn't work we try again.""  People had an  activity schedule which was displayed using photographs. One person would select their morning activity  each day using a choice of three photographs of activities they enjoyed. Staff understood that activities  could be overwhelming for people and could lead to people becoming anxious. People's care plans gave  staff guidance about when to tell people activities were happening, how to tell them and how to respond if  people began to become distressed.   People had been supported to try new activities. For example, one person loved to have curry, but had never been to an Indian restaurant. The person did not like noise, so staff researched the quietest time to visit  local restaurants and developed a plan to prepare the person to visit. The visit was very successful and the  person had added this activity as an option on their planner. The person also had regular snacks each day,  initially these were chosen by the person from a selection which staff had purchased. The person could find  going into shops distressing and had previously grabbed large amounts of snacks and eaten them without  paying. Staff created links with a local shop, explained what they were trying to achieve and the possible  risks. The shop owners agreed to support the plan. Staff supported the person to go to the shop on a daily  basis to select their own snacks. The staff at the shop have developed a relationship with the person and  would welcome them by name when they visited.  The person now visits the shop, selecting their three  snacks, pays at the counter and returns home placing the snacks in the snack cupboard to have later in the  day.   One person was talking to staff about a local pantomime they were attending a few days after the  inspection. They spoke to the registered manager and indicated which staff they would like to go with them  to the show. The registered manager checked those staff were on duty and agreed that they could support  the person to go. Previously the person had found it difficult when activities they enjoyed came to an end  and this could trigger them to become upset or aggressive. The person had a goal to visit Disneyland Paris  and it was recognised that this behaviour could be a barrier to reaching that goal. The PBS team, PCP co- ordinators and staff team had worked together to develop strategies to help the person to cope when  activities ended. This had been successful and the person now rarely became upset when they had to go  home. As a result the person had completed several stays at local hotels, was planning an overnight stay in  London and aimed to go to Disneyland next year.   People also took part in activities which helped them to develop independent living skills. The provider had  developed a range of courses for people which included cooking and daily living skills. When people were  reluctant to take part in household tasks, these were followed by an activity the person enjoyed. For  example, one person was reluctant to do their laundry. The laundry room was close to the door leading to  the car park, so staff encouraged the person to put their laundry in the washing machine on the way out to  the car. This had been successful and the person now completed their laundry on a daily basis.  Another  course covered social skills looking at area such as sexuality, sexual health, relationships, keeping safe and  bereavement. As part of the course, they had worked with people to develop an end of life plan. This was in   14 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  an accessible format and supported people to think about how they would like to be supported at the end  of their life. It also covered the type of service they would like to have after their death and who they would  like to be invited.   The provider had a complaints policy and procedure in place. No complaints had been received by the  service since the last inspection. People's monthly PCP meetings included a confidential section between  the person and the PCP co-ordinator where they discussed any issues with staff or their keyworker or  mentor. If any concerns were raised during this process they were investigated by the PCP manager who  then spoke to the registered manager about the outcome. People also attended forums run by the PCP  team where people were encouraged to express any concerns about their care.  15 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   Staff told us, ""The philosophy of the provider is clear, we aim to support people to become fully integrated  into their community and live as independently as possible. It is irrelevant how far they get or what they  achieve, we keep supporting them towards that goal."" Another staff member said, ""The providers are very  positive and driven to make their services the best they can be. I was so happy with this that my loved one  now lives at one of our other services. I think that says a lot about the quality of care that Insight offer.""  The provider had a clear vision for the service and this was understood and shared by everyone who worked  at the service. The additional resources which had been put in place by the provider such as, the person  centred planning (PCP) team and the positive behaviour support (PBS) team ensured services were person  led. Systems had been developed and were consistently reviewed to ensure they were effective in improving people's support. Staff told us, ""We support people to do things which in their past others may have said  were impossible. We all believe we can do it if we work together as a team, with people as our priority.""  There was a registered manager at the service who was supported by a deputy manager. The registered  manager had worked for the provider for a number of years and was fully committed to the provider's  philosophy. They were a trainer for the crisis and physical intervention system used by the provider and  shared this knowledge to support the provider's other services when required.   People told us they liked the registered manager and the deputy manager. Staff and professionals told us  the management team were approachable, accessible and knowledgeable. The PBS co-ordinator, deputy  manager and registered manager often worked alongside staff on duty mentoring and role modelling for  them. If a change was made to a person's PBS plan then role modelling was increased to ensure staff  understood what was expected of them and felt confident in following the plan. Staff told us this support  helped them to feel confident in their roles and to meet people's needs.   The PBS team had worked with the providers and registered managers from all the services to develop a  tool that made staff performance measurable. This was used on a regular basis to ensure that staff were  engaging with people in a meaningful way, following their care plans and offering consistent support. Staff  were encouraged to support each other. During the inspection experienced staff were sharing their  knowledge and giving tips about supporting people to a newer member of staff. Staff told us they were  constantly learning from each other and the people they supported.  The provider had put in place systems to audit and monitor the quality of care people were receiving. These  included standard audits such as health and safety audits, medicines audits and audits relating to staff  supervisions or team meetings. In addition to this more specialised audits had been developed, the PBS  team carried out audits of people's meaningful engagement in activities, how often people went out and  their involvement in household tasks. They also reviewed any behavioural incidents and physical  interventions. This information was used to increase understanding of people's needs and adapt their  support accordingly.   16 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  The PCP team completed monthly audits which reviewed the need for additional staff training, people's  care pathway, people's quality of life and evidence of people's involvement in planning their own care and  support. A new online care planning tool was being implemented and the PCP team working to ensure it  would meet the needs of the service and support the systems for continual improvement which were  already in place.   Regular meetings were held with the provider, which were attended by the registered managers of their  services the PCP and PBS teams. Case studies of incidents were used to share experiences, collect ideas for  resolutions and provide support. Good practice and successful improvements were also shared between  services.   Feedback was regularly sought from relatives, staff and other professionals. All feedback was summarised  and any learning was shared via notice boards. Feedback from people was gained in a range of ways  including monitoring of behavioural incidents, monthly meetings and client forums. The PCP team sought  innovative ways to engage people in forum meetings. For example, when people did not attend, the PCP co- ordinator spoke to people individually to find out what the barriers to them attending were. One person said they would come if they could make the refreshments for everyone and help the staff. This was arranged  and the person now attends every meeting in their role as 'assistant.'   There was a clear focus on learning and using this to improve the service. Staff told us they were encouraged to see every interaction with people as a learning opportunity whether it went successfully or not. One staff  member said, ""We just don't give up, we try another way or even just on another day when the person is in a  different state of mind."" There was a 'no blame' culture where staff were encouraged to reflect on their own  actions and review how they may have  impacted on incidents of challenging behaviour and share their  learning with the team. The providers understood the impact supporting people through challenging  behaviour incidents could have on staff. They actively sought ways to improve staff support and learn from  incidents. There was a clear understanding that each staff member would react to incidents differently and  support was offered in a way tailored to the needs of each staff member.   Professionals told us the service was transparent and open. A health care professional said, ""I have monthly  incident forms sent through to keep me up to date with each individual and the challenges they have  experienced. They work proactively with the individual to manage their behaviours and provide the right  support.""  Services that provide health and social care to people are required to inform the Care Quality Commission,  (CQC), of important events that happen in the service. CQC check that appropriate action had been taken.  The registered manager had submitted notifications to CQC in an appropriate and timely manner and in line with guidance. It is a legal requirement that a provider's latest CQC inspection report rating is displayed at  the service where a rating has been given. This is so that people, visitors and those seeking information  about the service can be informed of our judgments. We found the provider had conspicuously displayed  their rating in the reception.  17 Aspley House Inspection report 09 February 2018  "

At the last inspection on 1 April 2015, no  regulations had been breached and the service was rated good overall but there was some improvement  required in certain aspects of the service.  At this inspection we found that improvements had been made.   Victoria Lodge Care Home is a residential care home which provides accommodation with personal care for  up to 24 older people.  At the time of our inspection 22 people were living at the home.   A registered manager was in place.   A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  and associated Regulations about how the service is run.    People living in Victoria Lodge were very happy with the service they received because they felt safe,  comfortable and valued by the staff that supported them. The registered manager and provider provided  very strong leadership that ensured that people were at the centre of everything that was done. The  registered manager and provider led by example and ensured the development of an ethos and culture  where people were valued as individuals and where they were supported to feel at home. This helped  people to feel a sense of belonging and being valued.    The registered manager carried out audits and checks to ensure the home was running properly to meet  people's needs and to monitor the quality of the care people received. The provider was involved in the  home on a daily basis and knew people and their relatives personally and showed a keen interest in their  well being. There were close links with the local community shops and services so that people were able to  do everyday things such as shopping. The registered manager was involved in supporting local schools to  develop their students' interests in the needs of people that received care in an effort to encourage them to  consider a career in health and social care. Improvements were identified through consultation with people, relatives and professionals involved in the home. For example, the provider had planned to provide  accommodation for relatives to use so that they could be close to their loved ones when they were unwell.   This showed that the provider placed a high value on meeting the needs of people and their relatives.  People received care that was kind and compassionate, tailored to the individual and provided by staff that  were respectful, trained, well supported and managed to ensure that people received an excellent caring  service. Relationships with families and friends were cherished and developed so that people were able to  maintain and develop their ties with people important to them. Friends and families built relationships with  other people living in the home and often continued to visit them after their own family members had  passed away. This provided people living in the home with a continuation of friendships and interactions  with a wide group of people that were interested in them as individuals and that enhanced their quality of  life. Staff had been commended by relatives about the support they and their loved ones had received  during the difficult times at the end of their loved one's lives.  2 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  People were supported to eat in a calm and supportive environment that provided opportunity to socialise  as well as eat. People received food and drinks that they liked and that met their dietary needs. A freshly  prepared meal was available to people in the home on a daily basis and some people were able to be  involved in the mealtime experience through baking, setting the tables and clearing up after meals. People  were enabled to eat at times that suited their needs and a freshly prepared meal available at most times  during the day.  Staff told us they liked working in the home because they had time to spend with people supporting them in the way they [people] wanted. Staff treated people professionally but also that showed that people were  valued and important to them through the way they were spoken with, offering reassurance through hugs  and holding people's hand if appropriate. Staff felt supported by the registered manager and provider and  were supported through training and meetings where their views were listened to. Staff were encouraged to  develop their skills so that they could develop their professionalism and take additional responsibilities in  the home. Many of the staff had worked there for several years providing people with a continuity of care.   Staff were responsive to changes in people's needs ensuring that their physical, social and emotional needs  were met.  People's ability to make decisions was assessed and where people lacked the mental capacity to  consent to their care and welfare actions were taken in their best interests. There were excellent  communications with other professionals involved in people's care and people's friends and relatives  ensuring that all the relevant individuals were involved in meeting people's needs.  The provider had taken  suitable action when they had identified people who did not have capacity to consent to their care or  treatment and applications had been made to authorise restrictions on people's liberty in their best  interests.  People were supported to be involved in activities that met their individual needs and skills. These activities  were available in group settings and on a one to one basis both in the home or out in the community.   People told us they had no complaints about the service they received but were confident if they did, that  the provider would deal with it effectively.   No complaints had been raised but we saw there was a  complaints process in place.  People and relatives told us they felt the Victoria Lodge was a safe and homely environment for people to  live in.  People were protected from abuse because staff could identify the different types of abuse and knew what actions to take to report abuse.  Risks to people were being monitored and staff were supported to  minimise the risk of injury whilst enabling people to maintain a safe level of independence. People and  relatives were encouraged to be involved in the home and voice their opinions about proposed  developments.  We saw staff were busy but there were sufficient staff available to provide support to people when needed.  This included support for people to eat, drink and move around the home safely and to be involved in  activities that they wanted to be involved in. The provider's recruitment processes ensured suitable staff  were recruited.    At the last inspection although no regulations had been breached, some improvement was required in  respect of some aspects of the management of medicines. At this inspection we found all the required  improvements had been made and people received their medicines as prescribed.    3 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was safe  People told us they felt safe.  People were safeguarded from the  risk of harm because staff were able to recognise abuse and  knew the appropriate action to take.    Risks to people's health and safety had been identified and were  known to the staff.  This ensured people received safe care and  support.  People were supported by suitably recruited staff.  People were supported by staff to take their medicines as  prescribed.  	  The service was effective.   There were arrangements in place to ensure that decisions were  made in people's best interest.  Staff sought ppeople's consent  before they provided care and support.  People were supported by suitably trained staff.  People enjoyed the meals provided and were given drinks at  regular intervals, or when requested.  People's nutritional needs  were assessed and monitored to identify any risks associated  with nutrition and hydration.  People received support from healthcare professionals to  maintain their health and wellbeing when it was required.  	  The service was very caring.  People received an outstanding service from staff that were  extremely kind and compassionate. People were respected  as  individuals ensuring they were supported to make choices in all  aspects of their lives.  4 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  Good    Good    Outstanding    People's independence was promoted and where needed  support was provided so that people's privacy and dignity was  maintained.  People's relationships with their friends and relatives were  valued and the importance of these relationships was  understood by staff. The care and compassion received by  people was extended to families who also felt supported by the  staff and registered manager. Families were supported to learn  about their family member's health conditions so that they could better understand the impact on people.  	  The service was extremely responsive.    People and their families were supported in a very responsive  way that ensured that needs were kept under constant review.  Staff knew people really well and delivered care in a way which  met individual needs and preferences.  Activities were stimulating and catered to meet people's  individual needs and could be met in group setting or on a one  to one basis. Developing friendships and preventing isolation  was a very strong theme in the home.   People were provided with plenty of information and  opportunities to raise concerns but said they had no complaints.  They were confident the provider would address any concerns in  a timely way. The views of people, relatives and other  professionals involved in people's care were asked for their views so that areas for improvement could be identified and actioned.  	  The service was very well led.  People lived in a home where the ethos was about people  believing it was their home and where they were sure their views  were valued. Staff were supported and developed to be the best  they could.   People and their representatives were integral to the running of  the home and links were made with the local community to  ensure people continued to feel a part of that community.   Audits were carried to ensure that an outstanding quality service  was provided. The registered manager and provider looked at   5 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  Good    Outstanding    ways in which the service could be continually improved for the  betterment of people living and working there.  6 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017     Victoria Lodge Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This unannounced inspection took place on 26 January 2017. The inspection team consisted of one  inspector and an expert by experience.  An expert by experience is a person who has personal experience of  using or caring for someone who uses this type of service.  We asked the provider to complete a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks the provider  to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to  make. The PIR was returned within the required timescale.  As part of the inspection process we also looked  at information we already had about the provider. Providers are required to notify the Care Quality  Commission about specific events and incidents that occur including serious injuries to people receiving  care and any incidences which put people at risk of harm. We refer to these as notifications. We reviewed the notifications that the provider had sent us, to plan the areas we wanted to focus on during our inspection.   We reviewed regular quality reports sent to us by the local authority to see what information they held about the service. These are reports that tell us if the local authority has concerns about the service they purchase  on behalf of people.      We spoke with nine people, four relatives, the registered manager, the provider, three health care  professionals and three care staff.    We looked at records in relation to three people's care and six medicine records to see how their care and  treatment was planned and delivered.  Other records we looked at included three staff recruitment and  training files.  This was to check that suitable staff were recruited, trained and supported to deliver care to  meet people's individual needs.  We also looked at records relating to the management of the service,  complaints and surveys to ensure people received a quality service.  7 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   	  Good  	"   People and relatives all gave us very positive feedback about their experiences of the service and how staff  made them feel safe. One person told us, ""I feel safe with the staff.""  A relative told us, ""Definitely safe. They  [staff] constantly reassure [person], especially at night. They [staff] sit with her, spend time with her. We're so lucky we chose the right place."" People told us and we saw that the emergency call was always placed so  that they [people] could access it from wherever they were in their bedroom. One person told us, ""The girls  are lovely, always come quickly if buzzer is used [to get assistance]."" Staff spoken with were clear about the  actions they would take if they had any concerns that someone was at risk of abuse or their [person  receiving a service] behaviour showed a change suggesting something had happened to them. Staff told us  they would report any concerns to the registered manager or provider and were sure that the appropriate  actions would be taken. Staff were also aware of external agencies they could contact to raise any concerns  such as social services and the Care Quality Commission (CQC).   People's care plans included risk assessments and management plans. We saw that risk assessments in  place covered areas such as falls, poor nutrition and skin damage. People we spoke with told us that they  were aware of their risks and the actions that had been put in place to minimise them. For example, one  person told us they had to use the walking frame to minimise their risk of falling. People had equipment to  meet their physical and health care needs such as pressure relieving mattresses and cushions. One person  told us about the air flow mattress on their bed and the reason why they had it in place. This showed that  staff discussed risks to people's health with them. We saw staff put into practice what was written in  people's risk assessments and care records.  Staff spoken with knew about people's risk. These included  safety measures in place if people were prone to falls or at risk of choking and staff were able to explain the  action they would take. We saw that people had individual evacuation plans in place detailing the support  they would need in the event of a fire and staff were able to explain this information to us. The Provider  Information Return (PIR) told us that regular safety tests were carried out to ensure that equipment was safe. We saw that mobility aids had been tested to ensure they were safe for use.  During our inspection we saw staff were not rushed and responded promptly and compassionately to  people's request for support. People and relatives told us that there were sufficient staff to support people.  One person told us, ""The girls are busy but there are enough of them. I think they are getting a couple more  staff to start this week."" During our inspection the registered manager and staff confirmed that some staff  had been employed recently.  Another person told us, ""You have to wait a bit sometimes. Not too long  though."" A relative told us, ""There always seems to be loads of staff."" A lovely lady does the entertainment  and she takes [person] to a little coffee shop and if she [person] is a bit distressed they come down to my  house."" Staff felt there were sufficient numbers of staff to meet people's needs. We saw that there was a  stable staff team at the home which meant that people were supported by staff that knew them well.   We looked at the staff rota which showed that the same numbers of staff were available to meet people's  needs during weekdays and weekends showing there was a consistent service. In addition to care staff there  were volunteers and relatives that were involved in the home on a regular basis which meant that people  had a variety of people to interact with. There were also additional catering, activities and cleaning staff   8 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  which meant that care staff were able to concentrate on meeting people's needs. The registered manager  and provider told us they monitored people's needs and staffing levels were adjusted if people's  dependency levels increased. Staff spoken with told us that additional staff were brought on duty if  someone was unwell or if someone was going out for an appointment. The PIR told us and staff confirmed  that the appropriate recruitment checks were undertaken before they started their employment. These  included a check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and references from previous employers. The DBS checks helped employers ensure that only staff suitable to work with people that needed support were  employed.  Medicines were managed safely and ensured people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us  that they always received their medicines on time. One person said, ""I get my medicines, they [staff] bring  them four times a day.""  People spoken with knew what medicines they were taken and what they were for.  The medicines storage room and trolley were kept locked when not in use ensuring that only the authorised  staff were able to access the medicines. Stock was managed well so that people were not left without  medicines they needed. Medicine administration records had been completed as required and protocols  were in place where medicines had to be given on as and when required basis. Protocols were also in place  for when medicines were given disguised in food and drink. An assessment had been carried out by the  person's GP to ensure the medicines were required to be given in this way because it was in the person's  best interests so they remained healthy.  Medicines were given consistently by staff that had been trained in  safe medicines management and that had access to the appropriate guidance.   9 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives we spoke with told us that the service was very effective at meeting their needs. One  person said, ""It's nice here, staff help me when needed."" Before our inspection we had received some  positive comments from relatives telling us about the excellent care people received. One relative told us  that the person receiving the service and the family had been very happy with the care given by staff during  the time the person was in the home.  Another relative commented, ""From our experience, we have found  that the facilities and care are excellent."" One professional involved in the home told us that they found the  home to be ""hassle free"" and had knew that advice given would be followed by the care staff.  Staff were supported to provide good, effective care to people through training, advice and guidance. Staff  development was encouraged and supported so they took responsibility and ownership to deliver good  care that met people's individual needs. . One person receiving a service told us, ""Staff know what they are  doing. The girls [staff] are great."" Staff told us that they received induction training based on the care  certificate when they started work. The care certificate is a framework for good practice for the induction of  staff and sets out what they should know to provide good, effective care. Staff spoken with and training  records looked at showed that staff received ongoing training. Staff spoken with confirmed training enabled  them to have up to date knowledge and skills to ensure people were cared for safely and effectively. One  member of staff told us, ""[name of registered manager] and [provider] encourage us to do further training  and take on roles that we are responsible for."" Staff spoken with and records showed that staff received  regular one to one discussion with a senior member of staff to discuss their development.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People told us that staff always asked what help they wanted and that they were able to do as  much for themselves as possible. For example, one person told us they were able to get up when they  wanted and was quite independent in getting themselves washed and dressed. Another person told us,  ""They [staff] do ask. For example, do I want to get up?"" We saw that mental capacity assessments were in place for the people that had limited capacity to make  major decisions about their care. Staff spoken with and records confirmed that relatives and relevant  professionals were involved in making decisions in their [person's] best interests. Staff spoken with had a  good understanding of the need to act in some people's best interests to keep them safe.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are  called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the  principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. We saw that the registered manager had made the necessary applications for people that were  considered to be deprived of their liberty. The registered manager said she had received verbal  authorisation for two people and written authorisation had been received for one person. The registered   10 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  manager was aware of the need to inform us when authorisations had been granted to deprive a person of  their liberty.   People were complimentary about the food available. One person told us, ""We have three hot meals a day.  We have drinks in-between and we can have snack for supper."" The person went onto say that they could  ask for drinks at any time they wanted and they would be given one. People told us that the main meal was put on the menu board outside the kitchen and although there was  one meal prepared they were able to have an alternative if they did not like what had been cooked.   People told us that generally they liked the meals on offer and there was flexibility about when they ate their meals. One person told us, ""You will get something different if you don't like the meal but I like the food.""  Another person said, ""The food is good."" A third person told us, ""I sometimes don't feel like eating. Staff  bring me small meals regularly – five times in the day. The doctor has said to eat small meals several times a  day. I also have two additional drinks [food supplement] through the day."" Another person told us,  ""Sometimes I'm still in bed at half past nine in the morning. I can still have my breakfast if I get up late."" A  relative told us, ""The food's really good, it's all homemade.""  The registered manager and provider told us that there were some meals that were ready prepared and  could be cooked at short notice. This meant people could still have a freshly cooked meal, if they had a  missed a meal for any reason.   We saw that people received assistance and encouragement to eat their meal when needed. Staff told us  that they monitored people to ensure that they were eating sufficient amounts to remain healthy.  This  included observing what people were eating on a day to day basis and raising concerns if they noted that  people were not eating well. Meals could be fortified to increase people's calorie intake. People's weights  were monitored for possible signs of underlining medical problems.  Records showed that there was input  from healthcare professionals if there were concerns about people not eating well or having swallowing  difficulties.  People health was monitored routinely to help their well-being. People told us about on going monitoring  for conditions they had and told us that they were able to see the doctor if they felt unwell. A relative told us  about an occasion when their family member was unwell and a blood test was arranged which showed  raised blood sugar levels. The relative told us staff were, ""On the ball"".   A number of health professionals visited the service to assess people and support them to remain as  healthy as possible. These included doctors, nurses, opticians and chiropodists. We spoke with two  professionals that visited the home. Both told us that they felt people were supported to maintain their  health and any advice they gave to staff was followed and advice sought when needed. During our  inspection we saw a nurse visiting the home to assess people and support the staff to minimise the risk of  skin damage to people who were at risk. There was no one in the home at the time of our inspection that  had developed any skin damage whilst living there. People told us that they could see the doctor when they  needed to see one and they were supported to attend hospital appointments. One person told us, ""I get to  see GP and attend hospital reviews.""  11 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People living in Victoria Lodge were happy because they felt valued as individuals by the people that lived  there, the staff that worked there, the registered manager and provider. We observed  a very homely  atmosphere in the home and relatives told us that this is what they liked about Victoria Lodge. Our  observations of this were reinforced to us by an individual that lived at Victoria Lodge who encouraged us to  come back and visit them and told us, ""The door is always open. You know you're always welcome. There'll  be tea and cake for you."" This showed the person was acting as a host, confident in the belief that this was  their home. A comment we had received from a relative about the service said, ""During her stay she was  treated with extreme care and respect whilst ensuring her wellbeing and dignity were paramount at all  times. In fact she felt so comfortable from the first day she said she did not want to return to her own  bungalow and referred to Victoria Lodge as 'The Hotel'. Even when she had a fall and was hospitalised for  two weeks she was desperate to return to 'The Hotel'. Which she achieved. The love and care which she was  given by all of the staff was magnificent. Equally the friendliness and support given to family not only at the  end of mum's life but during the whole of her stay to the extent, as a family, we very quickly came to look on  all of the staff as friends .""   A relative told us that one person had liked the home so much they did not want to leave after they came to  the home for a short stay. The relative said, ""She came for three weeks respite and when we came to collect  her she said ""Do I have to go home?"" The person had been there ever since. The relative went on to say, ""To  this day she [person] loves it. We can see her deteriorate, but she says, ""This is my home."" A healthcare  professional involved in the home told us, ""The home has a friendly feel to it and staff are very attentive,  respectful and professional with myself and service users."" We saw people were spoken with by staff in a  caring, respectful and dignified way because staff used people's preferred names to address them, or using  words of endearment to which people responded with smiles and we saw staff hug people providing  contact and affection. There was a real affection in the way staff spoke with people and gave them  reassurances.   The ethos and culture developed by the registered manager and staff was one of valuing people and  treating people as individuals. Care people received was very kind, caring and compassionate. Staff took  time to listen to people, respond to their questions and interacted with people as they went about their  tasks. Staff spent time chatting, laughing, joking and dancing with people. We saw that touch, such as  holding people's hands and  giving them a hug,  was used by staff to reassure people and  to make them feel valued,. We saw that people enjoyed this interaction through the smiles and banter they shared with staff.   We saw that support was offered to people discreetly. We saw that support provided at lunchtime was  correctly paced to meet the needs of the individuals and ensured that people were supported to eat as  independently as possible. Everyone we spoke with was very complimentary about the staff that supported  them.   Comments and compliments that had been received by the registered manager from families of people that  had passed away showed that the care provided had been extremely caring and compassionate for both the individual and the family members. We saw that relatives were encouraged to visit the home for tea and a   12 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  chat even after their family member was no longer resident at the home so that they could  maintain  relationships with people they had come to consider as friends and were able to share memories of their  loved ones. One person's relatives had been supported to continue to visit the home, with their dog, who  had become a welcomed visitor to the home for a number of people that lived there. This meant that people could continue to see the dog they had got to know.   The caring attitude of the whole staff team extended to the friends and relatives of the people that lived in  the home. Relatives told us that they not only visited their family members but also spent time chatting with  other people in the home because it was like a 'big, happy family'. This meant that people met and had  conversations with a variety of people helping them to have a greater level of interaction with different  people. This helped to make life more interesting and created a sense of community between the people  using the service and their relatives.   The provider understood the importance of family relationships and friendships for people and worked hard to help ensure these were maintained. One relative told us, ""This is now our second home."" We saw relatives were involved in special celebrations such as Christmas, birthdays and running a small shopping trolley so  people could purchase small items of their choice so that they could retain some independence. Relatives  were sent a copy of a newsletter that showed what was happening in the home and at the end of this was  the activities planner for the month. This enabled relatives to plan their visits so that they could be involved  in activities such as quizzes if they wished.   The provider was very closely involved in the running of Victoria Lodge. We saw that the provider knew  everyone  living in the home and their family members personally and took an interest in how everyone felt.  The staff, registered manager and provider received a high level of praise for the way in which people were  cared for at the end of their life. Community health professionals were involved to make this passage as easy as possible for people. The provider always visited and supported people, and their families, when they  [person living at the home] was nearing the end of their life. People's passing was shared with the other  people living in the home in a sensitive manner. The provider ensured that people who wanted to attend the funeral of someone they had lived with were supported to do so and that flowers were sent from people that lived in the home if that was what they wanted. Thank you cards and letters from relatives whose loved ones had passed away showed their appreciation for the caring, compassionate service their relative had  received. A relative had commented, ""Her [person receiving a service] dignity, comfort and well-being was  unquestionable, also the support provided to our family helped us accept what was happening.""   People lived in a comfortable, homely environment that met their needs. One person told us that they had  been supported to bring their furniture from home so that they felt like it was the bedroom in their own  house.  One relative commented, ""Victoria Lodge does not feel like a care home. The staff and environment  make it feel like it is the home of the people that live here.""  We saw that the home was personalised with  pictures and belongings belonging to the people living there. During our inspection we saw that the music  that was being played was a CD that belonged to an individual living there. This reinforced to the individual  that their choice of music was valued and that the choices of people was paramount.  We saw that the culture of compassion and respect extended to friends and relatives who felt the staff,  registered manager and provider treated them as though they were part of an extended family. Meetings  had been arranged with guest speakers, such as from the Alzheimer's Society, to speak with relatives and  people living in the home. This helped people to develop an understanding of how dementia can affect  people and their families so that people could make sense of their experiences. The registered manager and  provider had also facilitated the development of a social group for relatives so that they could meet  independently of the home to share their experiences.   13 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  The registered manager and provider had an excellent understanding of how the 'atmosphere' in Victoria  Lodge was important to the people living there and the negative emotional states that people could be  experiencing. For example, people living with dementia may be experiencing fear, anger, depression and  anxiety. We saw that the atmosphere in Victoria Lodge was one that was calm, relaxing, welcoming and  homely which helped people to feel comfortable and well cared for. One comment made by a relative in a  survey said, ""A touch, a few words, time spent reassuring a resident whose visitors hadn't arrived, a game of  dominos - just some of the kindnesses we saw  that make Victoria Lodge a loving and caring environment for its residents.""   We saw that staff spoke gently with people and supported them at a pace and manner that was appropriate  to the individual. We saw that one person who believed that they were at the home until they got better was  not told otherwise. The registered manager, staff and provider told us that after speaking with the persons  relative's that it would be very upsetting for the individual to hear that they were not going home so staff  spoke with her about her[person's] 'convalescence'. The provider told us, ""[Person] probably does know  deep down inside that she is here to stay but does not want to say so."" This showed that people's emotional  needs were recognised and dealing in this way with the issue showed dignity and respect for the person's  feelings and a compassionate response to her beliefs and wishes.   People's life histories were recorded and staff spoken with were aware of what people liked to do. For  example we heard how one person was regularly involved in assisting the cook in the kitchen and another  person had been involved in planting bulbs in the garden because they had previously enjoyed gardening.  People and their relatives told us that they were involved in making decisions about care and that  communications between them and the staff were good. It was evident from conversations we overheard  that people living in the home were encouraged to share details about their lives and skills with others. We  heard one person say to a member of staff that she [person] was ready to carry on teaching the staff  member to knit. We saw that the provider also shared details of her life with people which helped people to  feel valued and important enough to have this information shared with them.  For example, we heard  people ask about the health of a family member of the provider and make arrangements to go and visit  them.   People told us that their privacy and dignity was maintained. We saw that there were en-suite facilities  attached to bedrooms so that people could be supported with dignity and privacy. We saw staff ensured  doors were closed when personal care was taking place. People told us staff always knocked on their  bedroom doors before entering. Some people had keys to be able to lock their bedroom doors when they  left them. Some people told us that they did not want to lock their doors. During meal times we saw that  people were offered clothes protectors if they wanted. Staff sat at the tables so that they were sitting at the  same level as people enabling them [staff] to support people to eat at an appropriate pace without standing over people and chatted to people about the things that interested them to make the mealtime a sociable  and enjoyable occasion.   We saw that where possible people were supported to maintain their independence. We saw that one  person was encouraged to eat independently but received guidance and support when they struggled.  Another person told us that the staff supported them to do as much for themselves as possible but were  available to provide assistance when needed. We saw that walking aids such as walking frames and sticks  were left in reach of people so that they could move about independently.   14 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Good  	"   Relatives told us that the supportive and responsive ethos of the registered manager began from the point  when people first visited the home. The registered manager supported people and their relatives in helping  them to choose the right place for the person to live in. One relative commented that when they visited the  home the registered manager had given them details of other services in the area. They had also been  advised about the type of things to look at when visiting other service in order to decide which care home  was most suitable for their loved one. They told us, ""[Registered manager] didn't just tell us about Victoria  Lodge."" This showed that the registered manager considered the suitability of the home for the individual  more important than ensuring full capacity in the home.  We saw that the personalised approach to care ensured that people's social, emotion and spiritual needs  were met. For example, one person told us that they were no longer able to get out to the church but there  were regular visits from the priest so that their religious and spiritual needs were met.  A relative told us that  their family member was anxious and unsettled at night and rather than the person be given medication to  reduce their anxieties the provider suggested they moved into a double room so that they felt there was  always someone nearby. We were told by the relative that this had 'worked a treat' and their family member  was much more settled.  We saw that a male volunteer came into the home to sit, chat, watch football and  have a game of dominoes with another person so that their social needs were met appropriately with  contact with people of their own gender. The activities co-ordinator told us that during the build up to  Christmas people had been supported to go to the shops to buy presents and cards. It soon became evident that there were some people that were unable to go to the shops due to health or mobility issues. In  response a local chemist, sweetshop, shoe shop and card shop were contacted who were happy to set up  an indoor Christmas market in the home. This meant that everyone living in the home was able to attend the market with support and assistance because the appropriate actions were taken.  People enjoyed a wide range of activities that were tailored to meet individual needs. For example, the staff  recognised that one person living with dementia was spending a lot of time looking at their hands and  pulling at their fingers. The person was known to have enjoyed knitting previously.  A specific activity was  organised where the person could sit and untangle some wool which kept their hands busy and they were  involved in doing something that they may have done in the past. The activities coordinator told us that they knew it was a good activity for the person when the person turned to the person sitting next to her to help  her rewind it. The provider had also purchased items such as sensory lamps, an IPad and communication  aids to help meet people's individual needs and make leisure opportunities accessible to them.  We saw that there were everyday activities that people could be involved in which supported their feelings of having their skills valued. For example, one person told us that they were regularly involved in cooking things such as  cakes and biscuits and we saw that pictures of these activities were included in the monthly newsletter. We  saw another person help the cook tidy the tables and sweep the floor after lunch.  We were told by the  provider that at the end of the activity the cook and person would sit and have a cup of tea together before  the person told the cook she was going home but would return tomorrow. The cook had become a 'special  friend' to this person helping the person to feel important and have a sense of purpose to her day. Other  activities in the home included exercises, quizzes, baking sessions and ballroom dancing.  One person living   15 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  in the home was interested in the how Victoria Lodge was run as the person had run their own business. A  member of staff told us that they had taken time to explain staff rotas, routines and the responsibilities of  different staff. The staff told us, ""She [person] feels very much part of what is going on now.""  Regular visits were made by outside entertainers and the ongoing involvement of relatives of people that no  longer lived in the home. During our inspection some entertainers came into the home to share their skills in ballroom dancing. People watched the entertainers dance before some people got up to dance with them.  We saw that people who were not able to move around were involved in some armchair dance moves.  Everyone who wanted to be involved in the activity thoroughly enjoyed themselves but other people who  did not like the noise were guided to another quieter area in the home so that they were not disturbed.  During this activity we saw that staff confidently were able to de-escalate a situation where one person felt  that another person had sat in their seat. The person was sensitively guided to another area and distracted  until they had calmed down and then brought back to enjoy the entertainment.  In a recent survey response, one person commented 'I'm encouraged to join in activities by caring and  supportive staff. There's a happy, caring atmosphere and we're not just sat round in front of a TV'. There was an activities coordinator who produced a detailed calendar of activities which offered different things for  people to do, at least twice each day. The activities programme was shared with relatives so that they could  be involved if they wanted.  The activities coordinator knew people well and told us that they prompted  people they knew might be interested in particular sessions. They continuously asked people for feedback  about activities and what they might like to do. For example, involving friends and relatives in 'the big family  quiz' and involving people in suggesting images to be placed on the home's website so that relatives could  see what activities were happening on a monthly basis.   We saw that people's well-being was being maintained and promoted because all the staff engaged with  people in ways that prevented them becoming isolated whilst also being respectful of people's choice not to always partake in activities. For example, we saw that where people did not want to be involved in activities  they were supported to return to their bedroom or to another sitting area in the home. The activities  coordinator visited people in their rooms for one-to-one conversation and individual activities if they chose  not to be involved in group activities.   We looked to see how complaints were managed. There had not been any complaints over the past couple  of years but we were told that the day before our visit a comment had been made to a member of staff  about feeling rushed during the support they received. This had been passed onto the registered manager  promptly who was looking into the issue. The individual had told the registered manager that they did not  want it to be a complaint however, we saw that the registered manager was responsive to even the most  minor concerns. The registered manager told us, ""Even if it is not a complaint it is a learning process and we  will use it as an example of how the little things can make people feel.""  We saw that a large number of compliments about the service had been received. One comment on the  home's website stated, ""Just a little message to say a big thank you for all your help and support over the  last few months. It is truly, thoroughly appreciated. Your help and support has been a god send. All the staff  are amazing and you deserve a special recognition for the outstanding work that you do."" People and  relatives told us that they would speak with the staff or registered manager if they had any concerns but we  heard again and again from people that there was nothing to complain about.   People were well-informed about the process for making complaints. The provider had produced a  comprehensive information pack for people, which included information about how to make a complaint if   16 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  needed.   Other systems in place to gather the views of people included regular surveys based on topics such as care,  safety and security, food and drink, communication and support. Comment from one of the surveys carried  out by the provider included, ""Always feel well supported and any issues raised are taken seriously and  responded to."" There were also regular meetings for people to attend. A suggestion was made by people  that protective aprons at mealtimes should be available in different colours to co-ordinate with the clothing  worn by people, aprons were bought in different colours to respond to this suggestion.  17 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   The registered manager and provider promoted a culture and ethos that was based on supporting people in a person centred way and to help staff to be the best they could, so that people received an excellent,   personalised, quality service. We heard people saying they felt this was their home and there was not a 'one  fits all approach' in respect to people, particularly people living with dementia.  People that lived in Victoria Lodge, their relatives, staff and visiting professionals were consistently positive  and complimentary about the service provided and the management of the home. The provider and  registered manager had developed and maintained a quality of service that met people's needs and  regulations associated with the carrying on of a care home. This was possible because the registered  manager and provider had a robust oversight of the quality of care provided resulting in them being the eyes and ears for the people that lived there. People told us the provider and registered manager were always  accessible. One relative told us, ""It's not just her [provider's] business and it's not just a place of work [for the registered manager].  There was an open and honest culture and people told us they would have no hesitation in approaching the registered manager or provider. People were supported and encouraged to be involved in the day to day  running of the home along with their relatives. Regular contact with people and their families meant the  registered manager and provider were able to pick up on and address any minor issues quickly ensuring  that people felt listened to and valued.  The provider and registered manager explained to people what they  were going to do to prevent reoccurrences of issues and apologised to people when things had gone wrong.  There were meetings for people, relatives and staff to raise issues and suggest improvements. We saw that  some of these had been acted on and where they could not, the reasons were discussed. The provider told  us, ""We listen, feel the emotions of our service users and become actively involved to ensure we are  delivering the high quality of care they deserve.""  Everything we heard and saw during our inspection  reflected that this was happening.  Staff told us that they loved their jobs because they were supported to provide compassionate care and had the opportunity to spend time with people.  One relative told us, ""There's no large turnover of staff here and  they're all interested in the people and the families."" Staff gave a resounding vote of confidence in the home  when they told us that they would be more than happy for their relatives to live at Victoria Lodge. Staff  morale was high because of the support they received from the registered manager and provider. One  member of staff told us, ""[Registered manager] has an open door policy, talks a lot [with us] so nothing is a  surprise.""  Another staff member told us, ""The manager will get stuck in if we need support.""  Another said,  ""The manager is approachable, experienced, knowledgeable and families feel comfortable in approaching  her.""   The provider told us that staff were rewarded through empowerment and a financial bonus scheme, social  events, but also by highlighting their achievements in the home's newsletter and by internal promotion. The  provider told us that they felt confident that they would be successful in the process of applying for the  Investors in People Award which was helping them to improve the service people received through the   18 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  development of staff that cared for them. A visiting professional told us, ""The standard of care is very good  from what I see. The registered manager and owner take great pride in making the residents feel they are at  home. There is a good mix of youth and experienced staff and the team work well together from the  domestics to the management.""  The registered manager and provider were constantly looking for new experiences for people so that they  benefitted from lives that were more fulfilled. They had built links with the community through the  introduction of talks on caring for people living with dementia by the Alzheimer's Society. They were also   part of 'Dementia Friends' and by working closely with this agency they had been able to put  advice,   information and training they had received into practice to ensure a more person centred approach to the  way care was delivered to people living with dementia.  Following discussions at a meeting with people and  their relatives the registered manager was actively working with local care homes to have mutual visits to  the homes to enable people to build new friendships and have new experiences. During the run up to  Christmas local businesses were encouraged to set up stalls in the home for people unable to go out to the  shops  There was on open and inclusive atmosphere where people were valued and supported to use their skills  and experiences.  Relatives were encouraged to be involved in activities, preparing the newsletter and  carrying out surveys and taking people to the local shops and facilities such as the doctors. People were  enabled to undertake daily activities which were important to them such as laying tables and clearing up  after meals and baking biscuits and cakes to be eaten in the home by people and their relatives. The  provider told us that they had bought an electronic device so that people could look at photographs on a  larger screen. Some people were involved in developing the website for the provider and some people had  been filmed with their comments about what it was like living at Victoria Lodge. Other people had been  involved in choosing images to go on the website.       There were good relationships with local healthcare teams who went into the home to advise on how to  prevent deteriorations in people's health. A visiting healthcare professional told us, ""The home has a friendly feel to it and staff are very attentive, respectful and professional towards myself and service users.""  We saw that the management structure in the home had been developed to encourage staff already  working in the home to develop their skills and roles and take responsibilities for specific areas such as  management of medicines.  Staff confirmed that they were supported to develop their skills and knowledge  to take up these responsibilities and felt a sense of achievement and personal development. Discussions  with the registered manager showed that she felt a sense of personal achievement seeing staff develop with  her assistance and achieve qualifications to improve their career aspirations. We saw that the registered  manager encouraged the involvement of local schools by offering placements in the home for students. The  registered manager had been invited to speak with students about how people leaving their homes could  feel a lack of control over their lives. This helped to raise awareness and understanding about people's  needs and encourage young people to consider a career in care so that people would benefit from a caring  and understanding future staff pool being available.  The registered manager ensured that she also developed her skills and knowledge through ongoing training  and attending meetings with other care providers. The registered manager and provider provided strong  role models for staff and demonstrated through their commitment to the service concern for people's  welfare and the service's focus on providing, excellent care based on individual needs.  In addition staff told  us that they had lots of opportunity to talk about work and personal issues and felt supported by the  registered manager and provider. We learnt of an example of staff being supported by the registered  manager when people told us that the registered manager was a good cook. When we asked how they   19 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  [people] knew this one person said, ""She [registered manager] cooked our Christmas dinner."" The registered manager told us she had done this because she liked cooking and so that the cook could have the day off.  Staff were encouraged and supported to raise any issues regarding poor practice. For example, we heard  about a passing comment from one person living in the home to a staff member who brought it to the  attention of the registered manager. The registered manager told us that this incident would be used as a  topic of discussion with staff. They [staff] could then be reminded about how their actions could be  perceived by people and to ensure that practices were continually reviewed and improved. This strong  leadership meant that staff were confident in raising concerns and people and their relatives were reassured that any shortfalls in the service would be identified and addressed. The provision of a consistently  improving and good quality service had been evidenced through a waiting list of people wanting to live in  Victoria Lodge; local authority assessments that showed the service rated highly in their quality  assessments; regular inspection by the Care Quality Commission as well as through the provider's  monitoring of views of people and their representatives.   A variety of methods were used to gather people's views about how the service was performing and how it  might be improved. These included regular surveys of people and their families and visitors, such as  entertainers and healthcare professional. This helped the provider to get a complete picture of what people  thought about the service and assessing whether any changes were needed.  There were regular staff  meetings and supervision sessions for staff as well as meetings for people and their relatives. This provided  an opportunity for people to voice their concerns, wishes and hopes for the future and provide praise and  compliments. One person told us, ""We have meetings and they [staff] tell us all about what is planned. We  can ask questions and any our input is welcomed."" The records of these meetings confirmed that feedback  was provided to people about what was happening in the home and took comments and ideas from people  for future development of the service. For example, people were consulted about the style and colour of new furniture for communal areas of the home.   Thought was put into how the service could be developed to improve the overall care experience for people  and their relatives and to improve the facilities for staff. We saw that there were robust systems in place to  monitor the quality, improve and develop the service. The registered manager and provider maintained a  close oversight of the service so that issues were resolved quickly and without a negative impact on people.  We saw that since our last inspection there had been considerable input into improving the environment  through an ongoing refurbishment programme. The décor had been upgraded; new comfortable, stylish  furniture had been bought and people had been involved in choosing the colour scheme. A new passenger  lift had replaced the older model. The provider had completed the Provider Information Return and this told us about improvements that were being planned for the future. For example, an area of the home was to be  developed to provide accommodation where relatives could stay overnight when their loved ones were  unwell or coming towards their final days. An additional seating area for people was planned as well as  additional resources for staff to take their breaks in in response to suggestions from people using the service and staff.   The registered manager had been in post for several years and with the support of the provider had ensured  that the home was compliant with regulations and met their legal obligations in respect of keeping us  informed about incidents that occurred in the home.  We saw that the provider worked closely with  Birmingham and Solihull local authorities to ensure people were kept safe. We had received information  about incidents in the home so we could monitor the performance of the provider. This showed an open  and inclusive culture and an understanding of the Duty of Candour. The Duty of Candour is a requirement of  the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (regulated activities) Regulations 2014 that requires registered persons  to act in an open and transparent way with people in relation to the care and treatment they received.  20 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  21 Victoria Lodge Care Home Inspection report 22 March 2017  "

Hale Place  Farmhouse provides personal care and accommodation for up to 13 older people with dementia. The  service is located between two properties on the same grounds, both of which are operated by the same  provider and managed as one service. There is also a domiciliary care agency and a day service run from the  location but at the time of our inspection none of the people using the domiciliary care service were  receiving personal care. As such we have not looked at the domiciliary care service or day service as part of  this inspection. Most people at the service were living with dementia and those who did not have a formal  diagnosis of dementia were living with other long term health issues that impaired their short term memory.  The service had three managers in post who were registered with CQC. A registered manager is a person  who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the care and has the legal responsibility for meeting the requirements of the law. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered  persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act and  associated Regulations about how the service is run. The service employed three managers and a deputy  manager to oversee all areas of the business.    People and relatives were overwhelmingly positive about the service they received. Comments included,  ""It's very good: excellent food, lovely people to care for us and listen to us, and we feel like we're coming  home when we come back here"" and "" I would say that the standard of care and the way of dealing with  people should be held up as a level that other care homes should aspire to."" Other comments included, ""I  would give them 100 stars and all the staff are so kind and caring. I honestly can't fault it and they are all  angels I'm 100% confident he's wonderfully cared for.""  People received a highly person centred service that enabled them to live active and meaningful lives in the  way they wanted. There were a range of varied and meaningful activities and people could still share their  lives with their friends and families if they chose to.  There was an open, transparent culture and people were included in the running of their home. Staff spoke  highly of the registered managers and their leadership style.  The management team had positive  relationships with the care staff and knew people well. The registered managers took an active role within  the service and led by example.  People were kept safe. Staff understood the importance of safeguarding people from abuse and knew how  to report any concerns. Risks to people's health, safety and wellbeing had been assessed and plans were in  place, which instructed staff how to minimise any identified risks to keep people safe from harm or injury.   There were suitable arrangements in place for the safe storage, receipt and management of people's  medicines. Medicine profiles were in place which provided an overview of the person's prescribed medicine,   2 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  the reason for administration, dosage and any side effects.  There were sufficient numbers of staff employed to meet people's needs and staff knew people well and had built up good relationships with people. The registered provider had effective and safe recruitment  procedures in place.   People had sufficient food and drink to maintain their health and told us that they enjoyed the food.  Relatives commented to us that the food was of a high quality, nutritious and to peoples tastes. People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported them in the least  restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service support this practice.  Staff treated people as individuals and with dignity and respect. Staff were knowledgeable about people's  likes, dislikes, preferences and care needs.  People's privacy and dignity were respected and upheld by staff  who valued peoples' unique characters. Good interactions were observed throughout our inspection, such  as staff sitting and talking with people as equals. People could have visits from family and friends whenever  they wanted.  Peoples' health was monitored and referrals were made to health services in an appropriate and timely  manner. Any recommendations made by health care professionals were acted upon and incorporated into  peoples' care plans.   People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported them in the  least restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service supported this practice.  No complaints were received but concerns and suggestions were used as a means of improving the service  and people felt confident that they could make a complaint and that any concerns would be taken seriously.  3 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  Good    Good    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 4 and 7 September 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was carried  out by one inspector.  Before the inspection we reviewed all the information we held about the service, including data about  safeguarding and statutory notifications. Statutory notifications are information about important events  which the provider is required to send us by law. Before the inspection, the provider completed a Provider  Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks the provider to give some key information about the  service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to make.  As some people who lived at Hale Place Farmhouse were not consistently able to tell us about their  experiences, we observed the care and support being provided and talked with relatives and other people  involved with people's care provision during and following the inspection. As part of the inspection we  spoke with the three registered managers, the deputy manager, maintenance manager, five care workers,  the chef, a GP, chiropodist and a nurse. We looked at a range of records about people's care and how the  service was managed. We looked at seven people's care plans, medication administration records, risk  assessments, accident and incident records, maintenance records, complaints records two staff files and  quality audits that had been completed.   We last inspected Hale Place Farmhouse in May 2015 when we rated the service Outstanding.  6 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017   	  Good  	"   People told us that they felt safe living at Hale Place Farmhouse. One person told said, ""I am safe here. For  one thing I know all of the people living here."" Another person commented, ""I'm as safe as one can be and  feel safe here. They look after me beautifully."" A third person told us, ""It's very safe here: everybody looks out for everyone else."" One relative commented, ""Yes mum is safe: I see her on a regular basis and they recently  moved her downstairs, as she was becoming less mobile, so we didn't have to worry about steps."" Another  relative told us, ""Mum goes out for walks with the girls [staff]. There is a key pad on the door and lovely  secluded gardens. In other care settings mum went out twice on her own when she shouldn't have, but not  here."" A visiting GP and two other healthcare professionals all told us that they felt people were safe at Hale  Place Farmhouse.   People were protected against the risks of potential abuse. The service actively encouraged people to be  aware of their safety: for example, the service displayed a 'stop adult abuse' poster near the front door to  inform all people, staff and visitors of the risks and signs of abuse. The registered provider had a  safeguarding policy in place which included more recent categories of abuse, such as modern slavery. The  policy had recently been reviewed and updated and contained information on the signs of abuse, actions to  prevent abuse, reporting concerns and learning from past cases. There was a link to the local multi-agency  safeguarding adults policy with information on what abuse is and what to do if you suspect abuse. Staff had  received training in safeguarding adults and spoke confidently about how to keep people safe from abuse.  One staff member told us, ""I know people are safe as the security here is really good. If I saw anything I  suspected was abuse I would go straight to the deputy manager or manager and they're very  approachable.""   People were supported to take risks to retain their independence whilst any known hazards were minimised  to prevent harm. People's care plans identified potential hazards and used effective risk assessment to  mitigate any risks. Several people living a Hale Place Farmhouse experienced problems with mobility due to  age and dementia and each person had their mobility assessed. We checked the mobility assessment for  one person and it stated they had issues with balance and couldn't walk independently, but would try and  stand up. There were actions to keep the person safe such as using the stair lift and a wheelchair. Some  people had bed rails fitted to their beds at night to help keep them safe and the risks associated with these  were assessed appropriately. Other people needed to use hoists and lifting equipment to help them move  safely. Staff had been trained to use the equipment and their competency had been checked by a registered  manager. The registered manager told us, ""I work on 'the floor' with all staff to make sure they use  equipment correctly and they are shown how to use each hoist in the moving and handling training. I've  done a quality check with all staff and we work with staff until they are confident.""         Environmental risks were being managed effectively through regular monitoring and checks conducted by  the registered managers. There were up to date safety certificates for gas appliances, electrical installations,  and portable appliances. The registered managers ensured that general risks such as slips and trips were  regularly assessed. Regulatory risk assessments were completed to reduce hazards around manual  handling, Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) and food safety. Each risk assessment   7 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  identified the risk and what actions were required of staff to reduce the hazard. Fire protection equipment  was regularly checked and serviced. Regular fire drills were carried out and documented. The service held an emergency contingency plan that was comprehensive, regularly reviewed and updated.  There were enough staff employed and working each shift to keep people safe and meet their needs. One  person told us, ""There are enough carers here. I don't have to wait for any help: they're always here to help.""  Another person commented, ""There are enough staff. People don't have to wait long and everything gets  done."" The registered managers ensured that the service was adequately staffed and that staffing numbers  were kept under review. In addition to care staff there was a cook and housekeeping staff. We checked the  service rotas and saw that the required levels of staffing had been provided consistently. Observations we  made on the two days of our inspection showed that staffing levels were sufficient to meet people's needs.     Thorough recruitment procedures were followed to check that staff were of suitable character to carry out  their roles. We checked three staff files and found that criminal records checks had been made through the  Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and staff had not started working at the service until it had been  established that they were suitable. Staff members had provided photographic proof of their identity and  right to reside and to work in the United Kingdom prior to starting to work at the service. References had  been taken up before staff were appointed and references were obtained from the most recent employer  where possible.  There were safe medicines administration systems in place and people received their medicines when  required. The service used a monitored dosage system where tablets arrive from the pharmacy pre-packed  and in a separate compartment for each dosage time of the day. We checked the medicines administrations  (MAR) charts for people and found that medicines were being signed in to the service and counted correctly,  meaning that audits of medicines were being conducted accurately and regularly. MAR charts had been  signed correctly to indicate that people had received their medicines. Where people had declined medicines this had been recorded clearly on the MAR and the audit trail was easy to follow. Medicines were stored  safely and securely. We saw staff administering medicines and observed good practice. Staff checked the  medicine, person, route and dosage before offering these to people with a glass of water. We saw that  people were offered pain relief medication appropriately and where people were sleeping they were gently  woken and given time to process what was being asked of them.   8 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017   "	  Good  	"   People and their relatives spoke positively about staff and told us they were skilled to meet their needs. One  person told us, ""The staff are very good and know what they are doing. I wouldn't pick any holes in the care  they give."" Another person said, ""The staff give me every impression they know how to treat people and deal  with things."" A third person commented, ""The staff do a lot of training from when they start and they know  how to look after people."" One relative told us, ""Staff take a lot of time to sit and talk and find out what X  likes and spend time to get to know him. It's very clear on the records that I look at."" A visiting minister  commented, ""The staff always have people ready and they are always on hand to help out.""  Staff told us they had the training and skills they needed to meet people's needs. One staff member  commented, ""I've done the arthritis training which was really useful. When I first started I did the full  induction and went through all the procedures."" One relative told us how they logged on to the service's  social media page and was able to see that staff have completed the latest courses. Staff were up to date  with essential training that focused on health and safety, infection control, manual handling, and mental  capacity. Staff had been provided with additional training to effectively meet people's individual needs such  as, dementia care and end of life care. As some people at the service were living with dementia there was  training available through the QCF Level 2 diploma course module and on-line accredited training [QCF is  the Qualifications and Credit Framework: a nationally accepted qualification]. All staff were given recognised dementia training, including the chef, cleaners and maintenance worker. The registered manager explained  that once the training had been delivered the service updated people's competency regularly through  observations, as carried out by one of three members of the management team who were qualified  assessors. The registered manager told us, ""The deputy manager and I are both qualified assessors and we  can provide on-going training to staff. Instead of running the same training with people again we do  observations."" We saw examples where a member of the management team had observed staff practice  when supporting a person living with dementia. In these observations there had been learning outcomes,  such as 'Communicate with people with dementia' and questions, such as, 'Describe how memory  impairment affects verbal language' that staff submitted written answers to. These answers had been  reviewed and passed by a manager to prove staff competency in caring for people living with dementia.          The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. Staff members we spoke with had received training on MCA and DoLS and were able to speak  confidently about mental capacity. One staff member told us, ""There is a test we use asking questions to see if someone has capacity. If they don't have capacity, for example because they cannot retain the  information, we refer to the doctor and the family for a best interests meeting."" Staff members were aware  that mental capacity assessments were decision specific and a person could lack capacity in one area and  still have capacity in another area. On the first day of our inspection we were shown mental capacity  assessments that had been completed on a new computerised form. However, these had not been made  decision specific as per the Mental Capacity Act Code of Practice. On the second day of our inspection the   9 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  registered manager told us that they had realised that the format was not correct and had started to rewrite  all capacity assessments. By the end of our inspection process all people had been assessed appropriately  in relation to decisions relating to their daily care and routine.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes are called the  Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the principles  of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. When people had bed rails in place, appropriate steps had been taken to ensure they had the mental  capacity to take this decision and were able to consent to this or else a best interest meeting was recorded.  Appropriate applications to the DoLS office had been made for people who may need to be deprived of their liberty as they were unable to come and go unaccompanied and without constant supervision.  People told us they liked the food and were able to make choices about what they had to eat. One person  told us, ""The food here is really good. It's very good and people have enough food and drink."" Another  person said, ""The food is very good: excellent. It's all home-made, or seems to be, as we all come from  homes that cook or bake."" A relative commented, ""The food is always very good and I've seen the food  delivered, before it's unpacked, and there are great boxes of fresh vegetables."" Another relative told us, ""I've  been here for a few meals and seen waffles and ice cream and they get regular fish and chips which is great  for mum. They can have a glass of wine with the evening meal (which is right up mum's street) and they had  a brilliant cocktail party which was fab."" Regular safety checks were happening in the kitchen and he service  used the 'Safer Food Better Business' pack. Safer Food Better Business is a food safety pack produced by the Food Standards Agency to help small catering businesses comply with food hygiene regulations. The cook  had ensured that there was a clear record of people's needs likes and dislikes, including information about  people's specific dietary needs, such as one person being vegetarian and one person being diabetic. Regular temperature checks had been carried out on the fridge, freezer and food served to people. Where people  were at risk of malnutrition or dehydration staff had completed appropriate assessments to ensure they  received adequate food and fluid. The cook told us, ""People seem to like traditional foods so we stick to  what they know and like. We can vary the menu from one week to the next and the managers give me  feedback from meals.""  People had access to health and social care professionals. Records confirmed people had access to a GP,  dentist and an optician and could attend appointments, either at the service or at the surgery, when  required. A staff member told us, ""The GP comes in once a week or more if we need it and there are also  visiting opticians and dentists here."" A nurse who regularly visits the service told us, ""We've had referrals  through and as soon as get it we visit quickly and if they are concerned they will call us and request a visit.""  We checked the care files for several people and saw that medical needs were addressed and people  received the support they required. One person who had been assessed as being at risk of skin breakdown  had received a Waterlow Assessment which was updated monthly. A Waterlow Assessment is a widely used  tool to rate the likelihood of a person developing a pressure ulcer and enabling staff to take preventative  action. Another person had received the same assessment and had been identified as a higher risk so was  being seen regularly by the district nurse. The person's care plan directed staff to give the person two hours  of bed rest every afternoon to maintain their skin integrity. In addition to this the person also had a pressure  relieving mattress and a special pressure cushion to help protect their skin. Peoples' day to day health needs were met through the use of a daily 'planned care' schedule which prompted staff members to complete  certain tasks for people. Examples of these tasks included applying creams or lotions after personal care, or  to ensuring that each person had the correct number of staff to assist them with moving and handling. The  daily 'planned care' schedule was available for staff to view on a portable electronic device that they carried  with them. This ensured that people's assessed health needs were being correctly and consistently provided  10 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  by staff members.     11 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People and their relatives were consistently positive about the caring attitude of the staff. One person told  us, ""They [staff] treat us with respect: very much so and we try and treat them the same. We're lucky here.""  Another person agreed, ""We are very lucky here. The staff don't say 'just a minute' and go to another person:  they help us when we want them."" A third person commented, ""The staff are very caring and they help each  other if something needs to be done."" A relative told us, ""I would give them 100 stars and all the staff are so  kind and caring. I honestly can't fault it and they are all angels I'm 100% confident he's wonderfully cared  for"". A second relative commented, ""I know the staff are caring. It helps that the staff are the same people, so there's a low turnover and that helps. They are able to take time and they all know X and are friendly."" A  third relative said, ""The staff are very caring and always have a good word to say about dad. They put him on the phone to us and are never averse to us asking about how he is, which puts us as a family at rest.""  Staff members had got to know people well through long service and had built up truly meaningful  relationships that were based on trust and respect. One staff member commented, ""I've been allowed the  time to build up good relationships with people. They recognise me when I come in on duty and they know  my accent as well."" All members of the staff team, from the managers to the kitchen staff, displayed caring  tendencies through the relationships they had built up with people. One person walked out of a room and  mentioned to a cleaner that they were feeling down. The cleaner stopped what she was doing asked why  the person was feeling down and when given an answer gently put her arm around the person and said, ""I'm sorry to hear that. I know what would make you feel better: if I make you a nice cup of tea."" The person  agreed and sat down and the cleaner returned quickly with a cup of tea and spent a few moments chatting  to the person. The person was smiling and looked happier after this exchange. We observed carers and  managers stopping and taking the time to speak to people and listening to what they said.   People and their staff team interacted positively and staff knew how to interact with each person. One  person was a little upset when their relative had left. One staff member immediately came and gently  hugged the person; holding them and giving them time to speak. When the person said they were upset  because their relative was so lovely, the staff member replied, ""And why are they lovely: because they come  from you!"" gently turning the comment in to a light hearted observation that made the person chuckle. The  staff member remained with the person hugging and talking and redirected their attention to their dinner.  With this tactile yet professional approach the person was comforted and able to sit and eat their evening  meal.   Staff were outstanding in using kindness and understanding to support people who were living with  dementia and experiencing confusion. During one meal a person was disoriented and was struggling to  understand either what was on their plate, or what was expected of them. This could have resulted in the  person missing their meal. However a staff member noticed the person was experiencing difficulties and  approached them slowly and used their first name to establish a connection. The staff member crouched  down next to the person and comforted them by speaking slowly and softly and holding their hand. The  person responded by stroking the staff members hand back and speaking. The staff member then spoke  about food saying, ""You've got scrambled eggs on toast coming haven't you: you like that"" to which the   12 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  person replied, ""Oh, how lovely."" The staff showed the person their meal and the person was happy to eat it  saying, ""That looks lovely."" Such attentive support meant that people who would be at risk of malnutrition  due to their cognitive state were more able to maintain their health.      Staff were exceptional in enabling people to remain independent. People's independence was encouraged  and their involvement in their day to day lives was apparent. One person had moved from a care home that  reported they were frequently unable able to shower or wash the person. The person had refused personal  care and support and spent 24 hours a day in their pyjamas and refused to engage in activities. The  registered manager commented, ""We decided if we were to accept the admission we must create every  opportunity for him to make all decisions so that he was in control and was at home."" The management  team had established through conversation with the person that they were not comfortable with the  younger carers at the previous care home. The management team then personalised every aspect of the  person's room with the person and their immediate family prior to admission. The registered manager  explained, ""We obtained swatches and paint colours, brochures etc. and they chose everything including  carpet, wall and carpet colours, lighting, toilet seat, taps, all furniture, door to toilet. We have used our skills  to support him to undertake regular activities and he is now engaged with others and leads an active and  fulfilled life, by building trust with a small group of staff."" As a result of this approach the person settled in to  the service well and accepted care from their new staff team.  The management team at Hale Place Farmhouse excelled in creating a culture where all staff members  could provide outstanding care. The management team had ensured that the ratio of staff to people never  dropped below 1:5 and was very often 1:3. This meant that people had staff members available to provide  care that went above and beyond their everyday care needs. For example, one person was supported every  day to attend a local park and use the free community gym equipment to improve the mobility of their arm.  This had led to improved mobility and greater independence for the person as they regained the physical  ability to do tasks for themselves. The ratio of staff to people had ensured that care workers were able to  learn the 'little things' about people that mattered. For example, staff knew the signs that meant one person  needed to be given space outside and were able to allow them the space to walk safely. The Director of Hale  Place Farmhouse had created a fully accessible garden for people to explore when they needed to. There  was a section of the garden dedicated to past residents. The director explained that this was not a  'remembrance garden' but was a space to celebrate people's lives. It contained quotes and memories that  were meaningful and gave people at Hale Place Farmhouse a physical space to talk about friends who had  passed.   The management team ensured staff had the tools to be highly caring as a team and as individuals. The  registered manager had identified desirable qualities in staff and had recruited to these qualities, including  how much the candidate smiled, their empathy and their caring attitude. Care workers who attained the  highest marks in their learning throughout the year were rewarded at internal awards ceremonies and  outstanding staff members had been recommended for national awards. The management team had  enabled key staff to take on roles as dignity and respect champions, end of life champions and dementia  champions. Care workers were able to access additional information and the 'champions' were able to  share best practice with their colleagues. There were several team building events held each year that were  chosen by care workers, including trips to bowling, and a Christmas party in London. Individual care workers were supported to attain qualifications to assist them to be caring: 100% of staff, including domestic and  kitchen staff, had completed the Skills For Care dignity modules and online training in equality and dignity.  All care workers had attained level 2 diplomas in health and social care as a minimum. The registered  manager told us this was to ensure that, ""Values like humanity, inclusion, dignity and celebrating and  promoting diversity are the bedrock of our provision and all staff buy in to that."" The care we witnessed  people experiencing at Hale Place Farmhouse bore this out.   13 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  People's privacy and dignity was respected by staff. We observed that staff members routinely knocked on  people's doors before entering and that people were confident to tell staff members they didn't want to see  them, and staff respected this. We observed one person sitting in a communal lounge who needed eye  drops to be applied. The staff members tried to encourage the person to go somewhere private for the  treatment, but the person became confused. The staff members gave the person some time to settle and  then re-explained what the eye drops were. The person responded by taking their glasses off and staff  checked with the person that they were happy to have their eye drops applied in the lounge, which they  were. Another person was walking around the home. A staff member joined the person for a walk around the lounge and 'orangery'. The person appeared to be counting objects so the staff member engaged them in  simple conversation asking what they were counting, how many there were and eventually suggesting  taking a rest. The person relaxed, smiled and said, ""Ok"" as they found a comfortable chair. This sensitive  support meant that the person's experience of reality was respected and enriched by thoughtful staff  support, without compromising their dignity.   Two bedrooms in Hale Place Farmhouse were shared rooms, with two people occupying each room. We  checked that where this had been the case it was appropriate and people's dignity was upheld. In one room  the registered manager told us that one person was scared on their own and another person liked to have  company, so it was decided with people's families that the two people would trial sharing a room. There had been an MCA assessment and best interest meeting with the families who agreed it suited both people's  needs. In the other room we were told that one person was used to sharing and when a new person moved  in it was discussed with the new person and their family and it was agreed that they would share a room.  The registered manager told us, ""They have both formed a really close friendship: like friends sharing in a  college dorm."" We spoke to the relative of one person sharing a bedroom and were told, ""There was no  distress at sharing and when mum shows my children her room, it's just a matter of fact [that she shares the  room]. A single room came up recently and we choose not to move mum as it works so smoothly."" We asked the registered manager how dignity is protected when sharing a room and were told, ""People never receive  personal care in the room together. Both rooms have toilets in the rooms and if we do need to help  someone with severe dementia we use the screen to protect their dignity.""     14 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People were receiving a person centred service. One person told us, ""The activities are pretty good: there's  normally a lot going on. I've got lots of jobs to do here and keep busy."" Another person commented, ""I really  enjoy the singers who come in here and also enjoy people who give talks about what they do and why they  do it: that's interesting to me."" A third person told us, ""Everybody has different tasks to do and they [staff]  know what hobbies we have."" One relative told us, ""They bought him a lawn mower, a push one, as he really  enjoys this activity: it was bought specially for him for something to do and he is allowed to help tidy up and  sweep and assist in the garden, which he enjoys doing."" Another relative commented, ""Mum likes to talk  about herself: she used to be a dancer and the staff talk about dancing. Today we were enjoying listening to  piano music which was right up her street.""   The service used an innovative way for relatives and friends to stay in touch with people. Hale Place  Farmhouse has established a 'gateway' which is an electronic portal, similar to social media apps, where  relatives and friends can access updates about the service and the care that their loved ones are receiving.  One relative told us, ""We feel involved through the gateway. It's uploaded every day. I go on it and can see if  dad has had a good day and it gives us reassurance. You can send little messages and pictures. We didn't  have this in other homes dad has been in and we felt detached. This is a really good system and it puts us at  ease."" Another relative commented, ""I am involved in reviewing the care plan and I can see them on the  gateway which is really good and they do the smiley and sad face so you can see on daily basis how he is.""  The gateway allowed people and their relatives to stay in touch and arrange social visits. Each person has a  personal profile and relatives can log in to read care plans, risk assessments and are able to comment or  upload photographs. Where a person living with dementia is having a difficult day, family members can see  a visual cue, i.e. the sad face icon, and contact the person and offer reassurance. Staff and relatives told us  of several occasions where people had been comforted by their loved ones after they had seen the 'live'  updates stating people were struggling. Where relatives added photos to a person's profile staff make the  effort to show people. The registered manager told us, ""Everyone loves it and people message me to say it's  nice to look and see mum is up, dressed and happy. It makes family involvement in reviews really easy."" The  security and confidentiality of the system is maintained by the registered manager managing and  administering the account so that nobody else can access other peoples' data. When people are assessed at pre-admission they and their families are asked to consent to their photographs being used and it is  included in the contract. Some people have refused to their photos being used and this decision has been  respected.                Hale Place Farmhouse used an innovative care planning system which they were working with the software  developers to improve further. Each staff member has a handheld electronic device that is connected to the  care planning system. Each person has a 'planned care' daily schedule that prompts staff members what to  do for each person at each time of the day. There was a system of symbols to denote different tasks, for  example a sink at 09:00 to mean staff need to offer the person a wash at that time. The system gives staff and managers a 24 hour view of what support people have received. Reports can be generated to highlight  certain areas. For example, a psychiatrist recently visited one person and staff were able to generate a report detailing all of the involvement of the district nursing team. This allowed the doctor to view all the relevant   15 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  information in one codified document without missing any data. One nurse who regularly visits the service  told us, ""They have an [electronic device] with information for people and this helps me to see info when I  come and care for patients."" If people have not received the support they needed then alerts are sent to  carers and managers. Because of the 'planned care' system care workers are aware what each person likes  to do and when to offer activities and more activities had been offered than before. In addition when  auditing the activities the registered manager had increased the number of external activities provided.   Care planning had been truly person centred, and where people were living with dementia, their relatives  and friends had been fully involved in the planning of their care to achieve personalised care plans. The care  planning system detailed the needs and wishes of the person, and recorded every aspect of the person's  care and support. People and their relatives were continuously involved in the care planning process and  accessed the person's daily reports from wherever they were, ensuring their loved one's needs were being  met. Relatives and friends were actively encouraged in support planning meetings to develop the life history  with the person and add photos on their electronic tablets. This included details of what was important to  them in the past and now. People's electronic tablets contained family photos, email access, skype and the  electronic care planning system. This meant that people could see their care plan at any time as well as  access music streaming sites and different apps of their choice.   Staff used technology in imaginative ways to support people and achieve positive outcomes. One person  had suffered from a serious debilitating illness that had changed their life from being active with many  friends and a good social life to being isolated. Previously the person was living in a rehabilitation unit and  was not in contact with his many friends from around the world. The registered manager explained they  supported the person to purchase an electronic tablet, setting up emails and skype so the person could  directly communicate with their old work colleagues, friends and family. Every evening staff went through  his emails with the person. When they received photos from friends and family, staff supported the person to take photos to send back. The registered manager told us, ""We ensured that he spent his evenings with the  same members of staff, allowing him to build up trust. When X looks at photos you can see the recognition  on his face. When replying we use a sentence at a time. This morning X told a joke and laughed so we agreed to send it to his friend who is coming to see him this month."" After ensuring the person had re-established  contact with their old friends, staff had researched and downloaded specialist games on the person's  electronic tablet. Staff had found, downloaded and encouraged the person to use finger motion games to  increase the use of a weaker limb, as well as quizzes about favourite topics to aid their short term memory.  As a result the person was regaining some limited function in their weaker limb.     Staff ensured that people's rooms were reflective of their specific needs and decorated with the involvement of people and their relatives. A person who recently moved to the service was supported by Hale Place  Farmhouse staff to choose their own wall colours, flooring and furniture. The service consulted the person  on the vanity basin and different taps and eventually provided a special tap with two levers to meet the  person's individual needs. In addition, the lighting was updated and changed to the person's requirement  and a television and telephone were provided to reduce the person's anxiety about being away from their  family. This had proven successful as the person had been very anxious on their arrival but had not needed  to use the phone. The registered manager told us, ""Just knowing the phone is there is enough to keep X at  ease."" Another person didn't like the pictures that were on their wall when they moved to the service. Staff  went and bought some calendars of the person's favourite bands and made a photograph collage by cutting up the calendars with the person. The person was supported to choose their favourite photos and arrange  them on the collage. Staff then helped the person to get the collages framed and hung on the wall in place  of the pictures. The person was very proud of their pictures and felt that their room was personalised exactly to their tastes.       16 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  People living with dementia had their room designed around their needs to ensure that they settled in to the service safely. People's bedroom doors had their photographs on to help them to find their way. There were  way-finding signs throughout the service and one bedroom had a specialist dementia friendly carpet that  reflected light in a certain way and had been purchased to reduce the risk of falls. There were contrasting  colour toilet seats in bathrooms to help people see these clearly and one person's bedroom had a dementia friendly clock that indicated day or night time, and they had an old style dial telephone that they could  understand and use to contact relatives. One person's room had been personalised to accommodate their  continence needs. Hale Place Farmhouse did not routinely provide commodes for people's rooms.  However, for one person who had been struggling to manage their own continence, staff worked out that  they wanted to use a toilet inside their bedroom and not any other toilets in the service. As a result staff  members purchased a commode and left toilet paper next to it. This resulted in the person being able to  manage their continence needs independently, whilst maintaining their dignity, where previously they had  been incontinent and had become upset.      Staff went the extra mile in providing meaningful activities to meet individual interests. One person talked to staff about how they loved afternoon tea when they were younger. Staff booked for them to have a special  afternoon tea day at a local venue, with a few of their friends from Hale Place. The staff told us, ""I can't wait  to see her face when we arrive!"" People enjoyed listening to music in the orangery. We observed several  people singing along to music from the 1950's and they told us how much they enjoyed having music that  they chose. Other people enjoyed classical music and this was played at other times. The registered  manager told us, ""We regularly ask all of our residents what they would like to do, whether it be something  small, like a walk to the paper shop to buy a bar of chocolate, or a paper, to organising theatre trips, cinema  trips, or wherever they express that they would like to go.""  Staff found innovative ways to meet people's needs. One person had been living at home, where they had  been described as experiencing problems with daily living, and needing routine and stimuli. The person's  family had been struggling to cope. However, the person's closest relative told us that, the person now has a  happy fulfilled life, where they have a sense of purpose and are calm, helpful and thoughtful. The registered  manager told us, ""We listened to him, occupied his time with meaningful activities, where he felt needed. We bought him safe equipment that he can use in the garden. Found pictures that reminded him of the era that  he loves and helped him to put collages together, then framed them."" There are times when the person  believes they are a staff member and this is sensitively accommodated by the staff team who assign tasks  such as sweeping up that the person can complete with minimal supervision. This allows the person to feel  valued and settled in their home. The person recently expressed a wish to see a tribute band. The staff team  booked for the person to attend a special night of music at a local theatre and the person is also attending  another concert with their house mate.  People received detailed and thorough pre-admission assessments prior to living at Hale Place Farmhouse.  Staff described how, when new people arrive at Hale Place it can be an emotive time for relatives who want  to know their loved one is well cared for. The registered manager told us, ""I always send texts, pictures and  videos on a daily basis, showing them how their loved ones are settling, joining in and enjoying their life. The relatives always tell me that it is so comforting and reassuring to see, that they can share things with their  wider families to ensure everyone's mind is put to rest, and that they rely on my communication to ease and  calm them at a difficult time."" Pre-admission assessments had looked at the person as a whole including the unique way that people communicated. One person had not initially specified how they wanted to be  addressed prior to moving in. This became an issue on the first night of their stay and they wanted a more  formal address, so staff were able to update their care plan immediately meaning that all staff knew how to  speak to the person in the way they wanted.     17 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  Complaints and concerns were taken seriously and used as an opportunity to improve the service. The  service recorded all complaints in a complaints log and these had been followed up in line with the  registered provider's complaints policy. The complaint policy had been updated recently and set out a clear  procedure for dealing with complaints and what action would be taken if a complainant was not satisfied  with the first tier resolution. Comments and observations verbally given to staff had been recorded on a log  and action had been taken to remedy any issues in line with the complaints policy.   18 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017   "	  Outstanding  	"   People and their relatives were consistently positive about the service they received. One person told us,  ""There are two or three managers and they're very good: very helpful."" A person who sometimes thought of  themselves as a member of staff told us, ""I love it here it's such a lovely place to work in."" One person  commented, ""The place is ever so well run. It's an easy place to live in and we feel very lucky to be here.""  Another person said, ""It's very good: excellent food, lovely people to care for us and listen to us, and we feel  like we're coming home when we come back here. It's very calm and we have a lot of freedom and they keep it secure. The bosses are very good and help each other out."" One relative told us, ""The management know  all the residents extremely well; they set the tone for the care that's given. They are willing to give people  hugs and comfort and it sets an example."" Another relative commented, ""[Manager] is superb. She is always  at the end of an email or you can call or text and they respond straight away: it's amazing service."" A third  relative said, ""The whole home made dad feel so welcomed when he came here and it's really good to talk  to managers who really know what's going on.""  Hale Place Farmhouse utilised a unique management structure in order to deliver a high quality, excellent  service. There were three managers employed to ensure that every aspect of Hale Place Farmhouse was  delivering a high quality service to people. One manager, who was also the director, concentrated on  business development and financial management. Another manager mainly dealt with training and human  resources issues.  A third manager focused on residents and liaised with families and professionals. In  addition there was also a deputy home manager to support the third manager in ensuring residents' needs  were met and care plans were updated. The registered manager told us, ""It means there is always a  manager on site. We have a strict policy on how many managers can go on leave at the same time so there is always a responsible person here."" Relatives spoke of the confidence they had knowing a manager was  always on hand and available to guide staff if the need arose. One relative told us, ""I've never had any issues, it just runs smoothly and I can always chat to a manager if I need to.""   Hale Place Farmhouse had sustained outstanding practice; it has made improvements over time and  achieved recognised status in several national accreditation schemes. One national website had recognised  Hale Place Farmhouse as a top 20 care home in the south east of England. The same website had awarded  Hale Place Farmhouse the highest possible score for ratings based on reviews from relatives. Reviews from  relatives in the last six months included, ""I highly recommend this home to everyone I meet: a fantastic  model of good practice which all other homes should take note of"", ""This care home is run by an excellent  management team, led by the owner, who are always available for any worries or concerns or to discuss my  father and his care. I would say that the standard of care and the way of dealing with people should be held  up as a level that other care homes should aspire to"" and ""My daughter is aware that I want to go there in  the future if the need arises. What better recommendation can I give?"" Hale Place Farmhouse had been  recognised at several award ceremonies. At the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Awards Hale Place  Farmhouse won the 'quality of care award' as well as 'sustained excellence in person centred care solutions'  award. Hale Place Farmhouse also won the 'best in person centred care solutions' award at Acquisition  International Magazine's certified excellence awards.  The service was a finalist in the 'outstanding care  home award' at the Kent and East Sussex Service Improvement Awards, and was a finalist in the 'dementia   19 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  care manager' category at the National Care Awards 2016. These awards were won via a selection of written  submissions of practice, testimonials from people and their relatives, and interviews with NHS directors and  NHS trust managers.  Staff members told us that they felt supported by the management team and were effective in their role due  to the oversight of managers. Staff were encouraged to pursue qualifications such as diplomas in health and social care. Two managers were qualified assessors and were able to ensure that staff completed their  qualifications. The deputy home manager had been encouraged to sign up for and supported to study  towards the gold standard framework qualification in end of life care. The National Gold Standards  Framework Centre in End of Life Care is the UK's leading provider of training in end of life care for generalist  frontline care staff. This means that if a person chooses to remain at Hale Place Farmhouse for palliative  care, there will be staff with the additional skills to care for people to a high standard. One member of staff  told us, ""The managers are very approachable: all of them. The management of the home is very good.  Everything is offered to the residents and us staff are managed so well."" The director of Hale Place  Farmhouse told us, ""We are members of the outstanding society and we contributed to a recently published  Skills for Care Good and Outstanding Care Guide with 8 direct examples published from Hale Place  Farmhouse. Our knowledge of good practice is, at the least, very good and we never stop improving even  though we have been operating for nearly 30 years under the same ownership and management."" The  director runs the Skills for Care registered manager meeting in the local area. This is a network meeting that  shares good practice with other registered managers in the local community. Recent topics discussed  included hospital admissions and how these can be made successful for people and the importance of good relationships with GP's.           The service promoted a positive culture that was person-centred, open, inclusive and empowering. One  relative told us, ""I would trust them totally if it was me needing care I think I would be well looked after I  would get care and attention."" Another relative commented, ""It is absolutely delightful. They are wonderful  and so much nicer than the big homes where people with dementia are shut away on the top floor. It's  perfect for X; it's just like a family home with a garden and he can come and go in the garden and it's lovely.  I'm quite sure I couldn't find a more appropriate place if I searched the whole of England.""  A third relative  told us, ""I like the fact that its dementia only and I like the fact that it feels like a family. They do things with  real kindness and do more than other homes."" The registered manager described a culture where staff  members were empowered to recognise their strengths. The registered manager told us, ""[The director] likes staff to work up through the ranks. I started 15 years ago on nights and couldn't imagine that I could be a  registered manager, but they helped me through my diploma. The deputy manager was a night worker and  has been empowered to recognise her strengths and be promoted."" When staff members had been on long  term sick leave the management team go out of their way to communicate with the staff member and tell  them their job is still there and to keep them updated on developments in the service so they are more  prepared to return when they are ready. The registered manager told us, ""For residents we embrace their  families when they come here. We find out about how they like to be treated and how they like to be cared  for and work with families to be person centred.""   Staff described how they had built an excellent working relationship with a local GP who provided services  for people they supported who were living with dementia. The registered manager told us, ""We have an  exemplary relationship with our GP. There is a monthly surgery with the same GP, with an efficient, daily call  service. I can text out of hours and the GP has even texted back about end of life care when he's been on  holiday: that's the type of relationship we've built up for the benefit of people."" The registered manager  described how the GP was knowledgeable about dementia awareness and how this combined with the  regularity of visits to put people living with dementia at ease when they needed to see the GP. The director  of Hale Place Farmhouse also attends the local surgery's multi-disciplinary team meeting.   20 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  The management excelled at ensuring people had connections to their local community no matter what  their cognitive condition. One manager told us, ""We have an agreement with the hop farm, where people  like to go, that we can order from the children's menu for our residents who have smaller appetites."" The  owner of the local garden centre does lots of fundraising work and activities in the local village and the  service are always invited and attend. The owner of the garden centre runs a very popular Christmas grotto  that sells out very quickly each year. Due to the close working relationship they have with Hale Place  Farmhouse the owner calls the service each autumn and books in visits for people before the tickets go on  general sale. The registered manager commented, ""For the Queens 90th birthday celebrations we were  invited to a party in the village hall and it was marvellous: everything was decked out in red, white and blue  and the residents loved it. When there are village fetes we attend and the Salvation Army attends and we  invited them to come back to the home to play."" The service held their own Christmas fete and residents ran the stalls. Children were invited from the local schools and monies raised were put towards the 'resident's  entertainment fund'. In turn the local school invites the service to attend parties and concerts. People at  Hale Place Farmhouse regularly go to the local fish and chip shop and greengrocers. There were links to the  local church that were maintained through people attending church fetes and carol concerts. A minister  visits the service regularly to hold sessions singing hymns. The minister told us, ""It's amazing when you start  singing hymns or reciting the Lord's Prayer and people [living with dementia] join in: they are simulated  here.""    The registered manager provided clear leadership and used systems effectively to monitor and improve the  quality of the service. There were a range of audits used by the registered manager to ensure that the quality of service delivered by staff was to the correct standard. These quality audits had been carried out on a  monthly basis or sooner. Where audits had identified a shortfall in service delivery the registered manager  had ensured that action was taken and recorded to remedy the deficit. For example, a recently completed  medicines audit had identified that a senior care worker had incorrectly dispensed medicines from the  wrong day of a pre-dispensed blister pack of tablets. The registered manager had identified the fault and  had recorded that the care worker would be monitored for the next three shifts consisting of six medicines  rounds until they had been deemed competent by a manager. Personalisation had been audited separately  by the management team and an action plan was generated. For example, people whose communication  was likely to change due to their dementia had been identified and there was an action plan in place to  review communication methods with people as their dementia progressed. The registered manager carried  out regular visits to all parts of the service, which included speaking with people and staff to review the  effectiveness of their support. Managers worked in the service alongside staff to role model. Observation of  practice was used, along with reflective logs to help staff develop their practice.  There was a strong emphasis on continually striving to improve the service. The registered manager had  actively sought and acted upon the views of others. This included an annual survey and daily visits by  managers to seek feedback from people. Questionnaires around 'safety', 'employment engagement' and  'caring, effective and responsive service' showed a very high level of satisfaction from people, staff and  relatives. Questions such as, 'how do you rate the care workers?' received replies of either excellent or very  good and 85% of staff reported they were inspired to be exemplary.  The registered manager was aware of their responsibility to comply with the CQC registration requirements.  They had notified us of events that had occurred within the home so that we could have an awareness and  oversight of these to ensure that appropriate actions had been taken. They were aware of the statutory Duty  of Candour which aimed to ensure that providers are open, honest and transparent with people and others  in relation to care and support. The Duty of Candour is to be open and honest when untoward events  occurred. The registered manager confirmed that no incidents had met the threshold for Duty of Candour.  21 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  22 Hale Place Farmhouse Inspection report 10 November 2017  "

Sandown Park Care Home is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or  personal care as a single package under one contractual agreement. We regulate both the premises and the  care provided, and both were looked at during this inspection.  Sandown Park Care Home can accommodate 95 people across three floors, each of which has separate  adapted facilities. The service cares for adults, including people living with dementia. The premises are  modern and purpose-built. People live in their own bedrooms and have access to communal facilities such  as a dining, lounge and activities areas. There is an expansive landscaped sensory garden surrounding the  building. At the time of our inspection, there were 84 people living at the service.  The provider is required to have a registered manager as part of their conditions of registration. A registered  manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like  registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting  the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service  is run. At the time of our inspection, there was a registered manager in post.  The risk of harm to people was significantly reduced by the systems and processes in place at the service.  This included prevention of harm by abuse, neglect, discrimination, injuries and accidents. People's care  documentation and the support they received ensured their maximum safety. When harm occurred, this was swiftly acted on and the service used any incident as a point for reflection and to put strategies in place to  prevent similar events in the future. There was a safe amount of staff deployed and robust recruitment  processes. People were protected from the risk of infections. The service was clean and well-maintained.  The management of people's medicines was robust.  The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) and associated  codes of practice. People were assisted to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff  supported them in the least restrictive way possible. The policies and systems in the service supported this  practise.   Staff induction, training, supervision and performance appraisals were extensive and ensured workers had  the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively support people. People's care preferences, likes and  dislikes were assessed, recorded and respected. We found there was appropriate access to other  community healthcare professionals. People were supported to maintain a very healthy lifestyle. People  complimented the food and drink and we found the risks of malnutrition and dehydration were  satisfactorily managed.  The service remained very caring. There was overwhelming complimentary feedback from people who used   2 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  the service, their family and community healthcare professionals. People told us they were able to  participate in care planning and reviews and we saw evidence of decision-making that promoted people's  independence. People's privacy and dignity was respected when care was provided to them. We observed  respectful care by staff.  The service continued to provide outstanding person-centred care. Care plans were thorough and  contained information of how to support people in the best possible way. We saw there was complaints  system in place which included the ability for people to contact any staff member or the management team. Questionnaires were used to determine people's satisfaction with the care. People and their families had a  say in the everyday decision-making and operation of the service.   The service was run by a committed management duo and care was provided by a passionate, effective  team of staff. There were numerous positive opinions about the management and leadership of the service.  There was an excellent workplace culture and we saw the staff worked cohesively to ensure good care for  people. The turnover rate of staff was low, which demonstrated staff liked to work at Sandown Park Care  Home. Audits and checks were used to gauge the safety and quality of care. The provider met the conditions of registration and complied with other relevant legislation related to the adult social care sector.   The service consistently strived to ensure that people had the best possible care, and that they were  supported in a compassionate, dignified and safe way. The service had forged successful partnerships with  an array of other stakeholders, was actively involved in research and innovation and aimed to provide an  excellent care experience for people. The service frequently referred to best practise guidelines to formulate  the type and style of care provided for people. Learning from projects and studies at the service were shared  with other care operators, both locally and nationally. The service's staff were often nominated for, and  commended in, national care sector awards. These factors demonstrated that Sandown Park Care Home  was a outstanding service for adult residential social care in England.  3 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  Good    Good    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was safe.  Effective systems were in place to protect people from the risks  of abuse or neglect.  Appropriate risk assessments about people's care were  completed and regularly reviewed.  There were sufficient staff deployed to meet people's needs,  although people expressed there should be better continuity.  People's medicines were safely managed.  Lessons were learned and improvements made when incidents  occurred.  	  The service was effective.  People's likes, preferences and routines were considered and  used during the provision of care. People and relatives were  actively involved in their care.  There was good staff support, with extensive staff induction,  training, supervision and performance reviews.  People's nutritional and hydration needs were met and risks of  malnutrition or dehydration were proactively managed.  The service was compliant with the Mental Capacity Act 2005.  People were assisted to make informed decisions or decisions  were made in their best interests.  The premises and decoration were specially adapted for people  living with dementia.   The service worked well with other community healthcare  professionals.  	  Outstanding    4 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  Outstanding    Outstanding    The service remains outstanding.  	  The service remains outstanding.  	  The service was well-led.  People and relatives described a strong, visible leadership  presence.  Research and innovation was used to continuously improve  people's care experiences.  Best practise knowledge and experience was embedded in  people's support and shared within the wider adult social care  landscape.  Effective partnerships with local community partners ensured  enriched experiences of care for people.  Quality and safety were continuously at the forefront of the care  people received.  5 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018     Sandown Park Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  Our inspection took place on 9 January and 10 January 2018 and was unannounced.  Our inspection was completed by two adult social care inspectors and an expert-by- experience. An expert- by-experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of  care service. Our expert-by-experience had knowledge of people living with dementia.  We reviewed information we already held about the service. This included notifications we had received. A  notification is information about important events which the service is required to send us by law. We also  checked feedback we received from members of the public, local authorities and clinical commissioning  groups (CCGs). We checked records held by Companies House, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO)  and the local fire inspectorate.  We spoke with eight people who used the service and seven relatives who visited during our inspection.   We spoke with the registered manager, the deputy manager, the administrator, the receptionist, three  activities coordinators and the maintenance person. We also spoke with five registered nurses and seven  care workers about people's support and treatment. We spoke with the GP, a visiting social worker, a vicar  and a representative from the CCG.   We looked at seven people's care records, two staff personnel files and other records about the  management of the service. After the inspection, we asked the registered manager to send us further  documents and we received and reviewed this information. This evidence was included as part of our  inspection.  6 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   	  Good  	"   People and relatives provided positive feedback about the safety of care. One person said, ""The location  layout; it works well for me."" The next person told us, ""It's got very high standards, clean with good staff.""  The next person said, ""It's comfortable and clean."" Other comments included, ""I get on well with all the  staff"", Very good and very caring. They have been extremely attentive to mum and me"", ""She (the person)  has improved very much since she came in"", ""It's a nice environment. (Care workers) have very good  personalities and are very caring"", ""(Staff) seem to care and understand her (the person's) dislikes. (There is  a nice environment )"" and ""Care from (the carer) is excellent with mum; understanding and patient and  always happy.""  The service had established safeguarding policies and procedures. Information on how to report  safeguarding concerns was displayed in the office on each floor, along with relevant contact numbers for the local safeguarding team. Staff we interviewed confirmed that they had training in safeguarding with regular  updates. They were able to provide definitions of different forms of abuse when asked. Staff said they would  report any concerns about abuse or neglect to the senior staff member on duty or the manager and most  said that it was also necessary to inform the local authority safeguarding team whenever a safeguarding  alert was reported.   There was good evidence that the service assessed and managed risks. Each person's care file contained a  pre-admission assessment of needs and risks and there were a range of dependency and risk scores for  different aspects of care such as the malnutrition universal screening tool, Waterlow scores to assess skin  integrity and falls risk scores. These were updated monthly, including weight records and were up-to-date.  Any risks associated with medical conditions, physical, environmental or psychological risks were addressed in the relevant care plans and in most cases there was direction on how to manage and mitigate any  identified risk. Any allergies were clearly noted at the front of each care file.   We made a recommendation at our last inspection about fire safety. The service had acted on our  recommendation. Each care file had a personal evacuation plan and a fire risk assessment which specified  levels of mobility and the equipment and staff support that would be required in the event of emergency.  This information was clear and well documented. We saw that the service had ensured safety from the  premises was properly managed. There was evidence of a Legionella risk assessment, gas safety certificate,  safety checks of the hoists, slings and passenger lifts. There was a health and safety checklist completed  weekly by the maintenance person and a periodic health and safety audit. The maintenance person was  very knowledgeable about how to ensure people's safety .  We asked the service at our last inspection to consider reviewing external access for visitors with mobility  impairments. We saw the service had dedicated a parking space at the front door for 'blue badge' holders  and had enforced parking measures to ensure visitors could easily enter the building. All other areas of the  service were reviewed to ensure wheelchair accessibility. Trips, slips and falls hazards were reviewed and  removed to prevent harm to people or visitors.  7 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  At our prior inspection, we made a recommendation about safe staffing deployment. We found the service  took action to ensure this was acted on. The registered manager explained the method of calculating  people's care hours needed. This was regularly reviewed and adjustments to staffing levels were made as  needed. During our inspection we found a strong visible presence of staff. People were not left alone or  neglected. Call bells were answered promptly. The registered manager explained that there were no staff  vacancies, and that the service had not used any agency workers. When we reviewed the rotas, we saw that  additional staff worked above the calculated deployment levels. Additional support to people was readily  accessible from the three activities coordinators.  Robust recruitment processes remained in place. This included thorough scrutiny and checks of applicants  for any role. We found the service ensured the correct information was available in personnel files. This  included proof of identity, criminal history checks, and references from prior employers, job histories and  health declarations. The service ensured only fit and proper persons were employed to care for people.  Systems were in place that showed people's medicines were managed consistently and safely by the  registered nurses. Medicines, including controlled drugs were being obtained, stored, administered and  discarded appropriately. We observed registered nurses during the administration of medicines to people,  and found their practice was methodical, patient and in line with local and national guidelines. The service  was subject to regular audits of the medicines management. We saw both the community pharmacist and  provider had checked medicines safety in 2017. Where areas for improvement were identified, these  formulated an action plan which was overseen by the deputy manager and registered manager.  All areas of the service were very clean, including communal areas, bathrooms and toilets. There were hand  sanitisers and hand gels available throughout the premises in communal areas and appropriate  handwashing signage was displayed in toilets and bathrooms. Staff wore personal protective equipment  (like gloves and disposable aprons) when they delivered personal care and at meal times. Staff said they  received training on infection control and the management team said they conducted regular spot checks  to ensure that infection control procedures were being followed correctly. We observed domestic staff using  colour-coded cleaning equipment and there were locked cupboards for storing chemicals.  We asked staff about the procedure for reporting accidents and incidents at the service and they were able  to explain this along with the forms that were completed in the event of an accident. Body maps in care  plans were completed and dated to record any bruises or wounds. Photographs were taken to document  any injuries to people. Staff said that there were daily handover meetings on each unit to discuss any  concerns or incidents. The management team were able to cascade any shared learning from incidents or  accidents. The service had a very low rate of serious injuries, like fractures or pressure ulcers with just four  occurrences in a one year period. The registered manager showed us how incidents and accidents were  analysed each month. Medical alerts and food safety warnings were obtained and shared with staff.  8 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives told us they felt staff were knowledgeable and skilled. One person stated , ""They are  quite knowledgeable, especially the nurses. All staff are very helpful."" Another person told us, ""Nurses are  (the best). (My) family rate them (staff) quite highly. One or two are exceptional..."" A relative told us, ""Yes. I  can't fault them."" Other comments included, ""Yes I do (think staff are experienced). They have got to know  her (the person) very well and are attentive"" and ""Yes, she (the person) is doing very well here (and is) very  happy.""  We reviewed a selection of care plans and found they were easy to navigate and well-ordered, with clear and consistent indexing so that information about people could be easily located by anyone. As this was a new  system of care planning, all information was recent with all care plans dated within the prior three months.  Assessments were carried out on admission and this information was used to develop comprehensive care  plans in consultation with the person and their family members. Care plans were evaluated on a monthly  basis with the person or their relatives, to ensure that they remained relevant and up-to-date. There were  separate care plans for each aspect of care. Each care plan outlined individual needs, the support required  and the desired outcomes or goals for care in each case.   Most care plans we saw were detailed, legible and tailored to each individual with identified risks, and needs clearly recorded. They were dated and signed by registered nurses and care staff. In some cases more  information was required by staff after ongoing consultations with people's families. There were clear  examples of people's and relatives' input into the care choices. This commenced from the pre-admission  phase and continued until the person's end of life. When a person was not capable of making care decisions  for themselves, independent advocates assisted them. We saw evidence that an advocate was involved in a  person's care choices. People were fully involved in their care planning which ensured effective care from  the staff at the service.  Nursing staff carried out assessments for people, developed and updated care plans. Care staff said that  they learnt about the needs and progress of people either by talking to nursing staff, to the person  themselves or by reading the individual care plans when they had time. Care staff we interviewed  demonstrated that they were familiar with the individual needs and characteristics of different people. They  were able to explain how to support specific people, along with any medical conditions or risks that they  needed to be aware of such as mobility needs, those at risk of choking and those who preferred to talk to  staff in their rooms rather than engage in activities.  Staff had access to very good support for their learning and professional development needs. Staff told us  that the service provided regular training, delivered face-to-face or online to ensure that skills and  knowledge levels were maintained. Examples of recent training included health and safety, fire training, first  aid, safeguarding, medication, dementia and mental capacity. Newer staff members outlined the induction  process that they completed, including mandatory training modules which followed Care Certificate  standards, home induction and shadowing experienced staff. The Care Certificate is a national standard of  minimum training topics for staff that are new to adult social care environments.  9 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  The  service maintained well-documented evidence of staff supervision reviews and appraisals. We reviewed nine separate staff training files and the evidence from 2017. Each file contained a central planner showing  records of planned and actual performance reviews throughout the year. This showed that all staff had had  supervision reviews at least every two months including one annual appraisal. There were sections for each  member of staff in the supervision or performance review, with a separate sheet to record each review,  signed by both supervisor and supervisee. There was evidence of objective setting and discussion across a  range of topics relevant to the role. Appraisals included self-appraisal forms and personal development  along with training needs that had been discussed as relevant. One staff member said, ""We're encouraged  by the home to undertake extra training, such as a health care practitioner course."" Staff interviewed  confirmed that they received supervision every two months (or more frequently if needed) and said that they had opportunities to progress within the organisation if they wished and were encouraged to further their  training. This ensured a knowledgeable and skilled workforce at Sandown Park Care Home.    Each person's care file had a separate care plan for eating and drinking which covered information on  nutritional status with detail on any special dietary requirements such as a diabetic diet, need for pureed or  fortified food and any risks such as difficulty with swallowing. There was also a good level of detail on  preferences and routines, any food likes and dislikes and any allergies. For example, one person specified  that they preferred small portions, while others stated that they wished to have a hot drink before going to  bed at night. Any cultural requirements were noted, such as vegetarian food in some cases. There was a  dietary notification form in each plan which summarised nutritional and dietary needs with instruction to  forward a copy of the form to the kitchen for their records.  People's weight was monitored monthly along with malnutrition scores to indicate nutritional risks and  track any weight gain or loss over time. Where weight loss was noted we saw that more frequent weekly  weighing of the person was introduced. We saw evidence of referral to dietitians where there were concerns  and advice and recommendations were noted in the care plan and in the section of the care file which  recorded healthcare professional input. In some cases where it was felt necessary to monitor risk more  closely, daily food and fluid charts were introduced in the person's daily folder. We checked a sample of  these and they had been well maintained with targets for fluid intake and in one case a calendar to indicate  any days where fluid targets had not been met.  We observed plenty of food and drinks for people. There were easy-read menus people could use, but staff  plated food up and showed it to people so they could select based on the appearance and their preference.  Where one person could not state what they wanted, we saw a care worker say, ""How about ice-cream for  your pudding? I know you like ice-cream."" There were snacks and drinks throughout the day in both  communal areas and for people who liked to stay in their rooms.  There was evidence in all care files of liaison and correspondence with other agencies involved in the care  and support of people including hospital services, local authority assessments and reviews as well as  specialist input from a range of health professionals. Visits from health care professionals were recorded in a separate section of each care file and these were well-documented with details of the date of visit, any  relevant comments on advice given or follow up required. We saw good evidence of contacts with opticians,  dietitians, dentists, specialist nurses such as tissue viability, and details of hospital appointments and  relevant correspondence.   A local GP visited the service every week or as required for consultations with people or to conduct general  health or medication reviews. We saw that details of these visits were also recorded in a separate log kept in  the staff stations with a note of the date, symptoms and outcome for each person seen. GPs also recorded  details of ad-hoc visits in care files. We spoke to the GP whilst they were at the service. They gave very good   10 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  feedback about their connection with the service. They told us, ""I have nothing but praise for Sandown Park  Care Home."" The GP described that staff were pre-emptive in their monitoring and decision-making about  people's care, which reduced the burden on the doctor's surgery. The GP commented, ""They (staff) know the people well."" The GP described that together with the service, they had reduced or eliminated the use of  sedative medicines for people, replacing this with better management of behaviours that challenge.  Each care file contained a 'care passport' which contained a summary of the needs and risks relating to each person, categorised as 'things you must know about me' and 'things that are important to me'. This could be used if the person was admitted to hospital or transferred to another service.   The service provided a safe and hazard free environment for people to move around freely, with ample  space in corridors and communal areas for those with walking aids and wheelchairs. The service was very  well-appointed throughout with good quality modern furnishings and flooring in all areas. Bedrooms were  personalised with individual possessions and pictures and there were memory boxes with personal items  such as photographs and other memorabilia outside rooms on dementia units. Communal areas were  decorated and equipped for the needs and comfort of people living there, including those living with  dementia. Corridors had been decorated in bright colours with scenic murals and some sensory themed  wall hangings. There were separate activity rooms including a reminiscence room that had been decorated  in a comfortable and old fashioned style with armchairs, a fireplace and old style magazines and journals.  There was good signage throughout the premises with bedrooms, toilets and bathrooms clearly labelled  and there were clocks in communal areas for reference. The service had followed the best practise  guidelines published by the Kings Fund for older adults and those living with dementia.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the  service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to  deprive a person of their liberty were being met.  There were forms to evidence consent in all the care files reviewed. There was a new comprehensive  consent form used covering consent to care and treatment as outlined in the agreed care plan, consent to  access documentation as required and consent to photographs. The consent form had a section to indicate  whether the person had capacity to consent and if not whether consent had been sought from a power of  attorney, if appropriate or if there had been consultation with a relative. There was a section on the form for  a signed witness to give verbal consent if the person was unable to physically sign consent. Where there was  no capacity or others authorised to consent, there were best interest decision forms relevant to each  decision such as use of bedrails, providing personal care or administering medication.  There were mental capacity assessment forms in relevant people's care files and these had been well  completed in each case, using the correct two stage test required by the MCA. Where a person lacked  capacity there were appropriate forms to document best interest decisions that showed involvement and  consent of relatives or others relevant. Where there was a power of attorney in place, this was recorded and  we saw evidence of the documents, as well as those from the Office of the Public Guardian. In one case there was a Court of Protection order in place and a copy of this was seen in the care file. There was evidence of  DoLS  applications and authorisations in care files where relevant and documentation seen was correctly   11 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  completed. Staff reported that they had received training in the MCA. All care staff demonstrated good levels of knowledge and understanding of the MCA and the key principles involved. All were able to clearly explain  the definition of mental capacity and the implications for care if a person lacked capacity, such as helping  people to make decisions and choices as far as possible using suitable language and alternative ways of  communicating such as signing, facial expressions or visual aids.  12 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service continued to provide outstanding care, formed compassionate relationships with people and  supported family members of people who were connected with Sandown Park Care Home. People and  relatives told us the service ensured they were treated with kindness and respect. People provided positive  feedback. Comments included, ""They will bring me anything I ask for"", ""Staff are kind and caring when they  are moving or helping me"", ""Oh yes, staff are always very pleasant. I know if I needed to complain they would listen"", ""They do their best"", ""Helpful and lovely"", ""They let me do whatever I want. I come back to my room  (whenever I want)"", They are very good; always attentive and helpful"", ""They (the staff) have excellent  qualities and understanding"", ""Very attentive and polite at all times"", ""Kind, caring, friendly happy"" and  ""They are doing their jobs to the best of their abilities. Very polite.""  We observed good evidence of gentle and unhurried care throughout our inspection with staff providing  appropriate and attentive care to people who used the service. Staff demonstrated that they were familiar  with people's needs and routines and knew how to support and communicate with them. In one case we  saw a member of staff conversing with a person in a different language. Although the person could speak  English, they liked to speak in their native language and staff respected the person's preference. We  observed that care staff were attentive and careful when they assisted people to move around the service  and were prompt to attend to call bells or other requests for assistance. We observed that people were  offered choices about what they wished to do or what they wanted to eat and staff were careful to allow  people time to express themselves.  The Accessible Information Standard is a framework put in place from August 2016 making it a legal  requirement for all providers to ensure people with a disability or sensory loss can access and understand  information they are given. People's support plans included extensive information about how to effectively  communicate with them. We observed many staff could speak languages other than English. Staff  conversed with one person in Italian and another person in Spanish. Throughout the building, there was  evidence information in English was translated into several other languages. Staff told us they used the  signage to help communicate with people. Staff could recite different food and fluids in other languages.  The service ensured that people had access to the information they needed in a way they could understand  it and were fully compliant with the Accessible Information Standard.   People and relatives were actively engaged in the day-to-day operation of the service. There were regular  'residents and relatives' meetings and surveys to gain people's opinions about care. One person told us, ""I  would most certainly recommend the home based on the way they have rallied around my situation."" A  relative told us, ""I have been to one relatives' meeting and have had a written survey."" Other comments  included ""They listen to any views"" and ""I have been to a relatives' meeting and any issues are dealt with. ""I  never felt we needed to keep watching."" There were no restrictions to visiting hours and people could have  small gatherings for special events. The service could provide catering as requested by the person or family,  so that memorable events were created. Staff often took photos of people's events (with their consent), so  they could reflect back on good times they had enjoyed. Print outs of the photos were provided to people  and relatives which could be used for reflection and reminiscence.  13 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  Care plans were person-centred and recorded a good level of detail in relation to people's preferences and  routines. Consent documentation and care plans showed extensive evidence of consultation and input from people living at the service and their relatives. Each care file contained a section on life history which  recorded details of past occupations, family and significant events. They had a good level of detail to add  colour and interest to the care plan. There was a form in the care file to record contact with relatives. It was  clear from contact sheets in some files that there was regular communication between the home and family  members.  We observed that staff checked on people's well-being throughout the day. As people moved about the  premises, staff greeted them and asked them how they felt. We noted on several occasions that staff  members asked if there was anything a person needed. During times when people did not wish to be  disturbed, such as when they were in a bedroom or alcove lounge, staff respected their freedom but  maintained a visible presence if the person needed something. We observed that people enjoyed starting  conversations with staff and engaging with them. We saw people laughed and smiled when they were  talking with staff. This demonstrated people had developed positive relationships with the staff team. We  also observed that staff allowed people to perform tasks for themselves, and only offered assistance in the  least way possible. This ensured that maximum independence was encouraged and people could remain as active as possible in their own care.  People's privacy and dignity was protected and promoted. Staff described the methods they used to ensure  that they respected people's privacy and dignity such as closing doors and curtains when delivering  personal care and ensuring that people were covered up as far as possible. We observed that people's doors were closed when staff were in the room to provide care. We also noted staff knocked on closed doors  before they entered and announced their arrival and asked permission if a person's door was open. Signs  were used on the outside of bedrooms doors to indicate that privacy was requested, so that people and staff were not disturbed during intimate personal care activities.  Confidential information about people who used the service and staff was protected. At the time of the  inspection, the provider was registered with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The Data  Protection Act 1998 requires every organisation that processes personal information to register with the ICO  unless they are exempt. We found the service complied with the relevant legislative requirements for record  keeping. People and staff's confidential information was protected.  14 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service continued to provide outstanding person-centred care. The registered manager and deputy  manager led the service by example. They placed people, relatives, visitors and healthcare professionals  before themselves. During our inspection, they excused themselves at times to attend to people or engage  with relatives they saw, which demonstrated their commitment to a welcoming, attentive service. When we  observed the interaction between managers and staff, we saw joined-up working, excellent team thinking  and a positive workplace culture. Staff told us they were happy to work at the service and felt connected to  people. People and relatives had provided 41 written compliments and positive feedback in one year.  People and relatives felt staff extensively knew them and the care requirements. The service's focus on  people had ensured care experiences were tailor-made and unique care was provided to each person.  We noted people's apartments were very nicely decorated to their choice. They told us they were able to  have their own furniture and belongings, and we observed the room was laid out in accordance with how  the person liked it. One person was emphatic that we viewed their bedroom. The room, walls and floor were  covered with family photos and celebrities. The person repeatedly remarked on how they were allowed to  put up all their photos and cuttings. The person told us they liked that the service had accommodated their  request, despite any damage that there may be to the premises by gluing and sticking items down.  People continued to have a very active social life. There was a special focus on people who were less  ambulant or were living with dementia. One activities coordinator, a specialist in dementia-friendly activities and reminiscence, was instrumental in putting together the 1940's themed sitting room. This was still well- used by people, who enjoyed the experience. The expansive sensory garden created by the activities team  continued to be regularly used, was wheelchair friendly and hosted multiple community get-togethers since  our last inspection. There were raised garden beds, tactile stimulating plants, bright coloured displays of  flowers and ornaments and areas where scented plants could be touched and used. The registered manager told us that both the garden and the service were nominated for the 2017 national dementia care awards.  The service and the garden were demonstrated as having a positive effect on people's physical, emotional  and mental wellbeing. We viewed the article about the impact in a journal and via other media. The  activities coordinator told us use of the garden would be further expanded in the warmer seasons. This was  to include informal dining in a casual sun-loving atmosphere.  One activities coordinator told us they used research and best practise to guide the type of programme that  was developed. The service has subscribed to a specialist dementia care magazine, showcased activities  that were different, unusual or newly tested. We could see some of the ideas were taken from the magazine  and put in place at the service. For example, one alcove in a corridor had been transformed into an indoor  garden. Two seats were available for people to sit down and look at, touch and smell the plants. A large  mural in the alcove depicted the outside world. We saw many people stop on their way in the hall, and sit  down to interact with the garden. One person told us they ""liked"" the garden alcove as they found it hard to  go outside.   Since our last inspection, the complete care documentation system was replaced by more robust and   15 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  detailed tools. These provided an even clearer picture or story about each person and how they liked to live  their life. Care plans however remained person-centred with information on routines and preferences as well as detail on any cultural, ethnic or religious requirements. Attention was given to activities of living which are often overlooked in older people's care, such as waking and night routines, preferences at the end of life,  clothing style and personal care preferences. People's preferred names were clearly noted at the front of the care plan as well as any preferences for the gender of care staff. We observed staff call people by their  preferred name throughout our inspection.  People's care documentation was holistic and successfully reflected each aspect of their life. Care files  contained a profile of the person with key details at the front of the file, including a photograph, date of  birth, admission, preferred name, contact details for relatives and next of kin, preferred GP, medical profile  and background, and any allergies. There were individual care plans for personal care, diet and weight,  mobility, moving and handling (including a falls 'diary'), memory and orientation, medicines, social contact  and recreational activities, eyesight, hearing, oral healthcare, podiatry, communication, skin care and  continence. There were monthly evaluations of each care plan carried out by nursing or other senior staff  and most were up-to-date, with a good level of detail. More detail would be added as staff became more  familiar with the provider's new care documentation.  When we reviewed the Provider Information Return (PIR) before our inspection, we saw the service had an  exceptionally low incidence of wounds such as bruising, skin tears and pressure ulcers. We also noted when  the service admitted people from nearby hospitals they were often able to completely heal pre-existing  chronic wounds and pressure ulcers. Where people had wounds or pressure areas these were documented  in separate section of the care file with a realistic wound management plan, wound assessment charts, body maps and details of any specialist input. For example, there was evidence of community healthcare  professional advice from the tissue viability nurse that provided advice on cleaning, dressing and bandaging as necessary.   Extensive daily records of people's support and monitoring charts were maintained by care workers. There  was a separate folder for each person containing daily charts such as personal care records, food and fluid  records (if necessary), re-positioning charts, topical creams records and night checks. These were up-to-date and correctly completed with records of when people had had showers or refused personal care. There was  a separate care plan for social contact and activities within the care file which outlined which activities were  preferred, level of engagement and in some cases, whether people preferred not to engage in group  activities. A separate activities folder was maintained on each floor with a section for each person  containing a daily activity log to record their participation in various activities or other social engagement.  People were provided with service guides which contained key information about various aspects of  Sandown Park Care Home. This included how to raise a concern or make a complaint. In addition,  information was available in the reception area of how to report issues concerning care, accommodation or  other matters. We saw the service had a satisfactory complaints policy and we looked at the complaints  folder. We saw the registered manager dealt with any recorded concerns or complaints promptly and  outcomes and actions were recorded. The registered manager was knowledgeable about their role in  complaints management. There was a low rate of complaints about the service or care, and all of the  complaints received were resolved.   The service regularly provided end of life care. There was a separate care plan in each file for people's end of  life preferences. The level of detail varied depending on individual requirements but resuscitation wishes  were correctly recorded and there was information on any funeral arrangements, family contacts, religious  or spiritual requirements. We saw the use of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)   16 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  guidance was used in palliative care plans. For example, there was an end of life checklist including relevant  aspects of care such as maintaining hydration, promoting dignity and anticipatory prescribing of medicines  for support and comfort. We saw end of life practice occurred during our inspection, with a vicar visiting and  supporting grieving family members and staff. A relative of the person approached us to provide their  opinion of the care, despite the difficult circumstances. They wanted us to know how the staff and service  had respected the person's and family's wishes, which resulted in a peaceful, pain-free death.  Where a 'do not resuscitate' decision was made in advance with the person and their family, the service  ensured the relevant forms were located near the front of care files. We saw they included advice from  multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. All were completed on original, legally valid forms and had been  completed, authorised and dated by the GP. At the time of the inspection, 95% of people who used the  service had made a definitive decision about their resuscitation preferences.  17 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018   "	  Outstanding  	"   The service's management and care team were outstanding. People and relatives described a very well-led  service. One person said, ""Very good (staff); everyone works well together."" Another person described the  registered manager. They told us, ""On the whole, she (the manager) is marvellous. She takes an interest and  helps out when needed. She is very approachable."" A further person we asked about the management said,  ""She (the manager) is very nice. Comes in now and again (to the person's room). Heavens yes, well-run. They all do their best."" Other comments we received included, ""She (the manager) is polite"", ""The manager is very  approachable. She took time to sit down with me and suggested ways forward. In fact, everyone has been  extremely polite and caring"", ""Let us say manager is on hand and you can go and talk to her. She is visible"",  ""We can't fault it. Everyone works together. There is a good environment. The manager is pretty good; fair  but assertive"" and ""I like the fact that the manager has an 'open door' policy and is always available.""  Staff sentiments echoed those of people who used the service and their relatives. One staff member said,  ""The manager is very helpful."" Another staff member told us, ""The manager is fantastic, very supportive,  always approachable. I can't compliment her enough."" Other staff commented, ""The management here is  very good. They know we work hard and show they appreciate us"" and ""The manager is very supportive and  very flexible with her staff if they need time off in an emergency."" Staff stressed that there was very good  communication between senior staff and those on individual floors with a prompt response to any concerns or queries raised. One staff member said, ""There is very good communication from the manager. She's  around all the time and really takes care of her staff."" Another nearby staff member approached us and  stated, ""If anything is wrong the manager's door is always open. She always knows what's going on and is  always there to provide help."" A national staff recognition scheme had commenced to reward outstanding  talent in the workforce. The registered manager described that staff would be nominated based on going  above their role expectations for people's needs.  Staff reported that the registered manager and deputy manager were visible and accessible at all times,  including out of hours. They told us there were daily 'walkabouts' throughout the service. All staff felt that  senior staff were approachable and were confident that they could raise any concerns or issues and receive  a sympathetic and considered response. Staff said that there were regular monthly meetings on each floor  as well as whole service staff meetings, at which issues concerning the home, queries or concerns could be  raised and discussed freely. These were in addition to daily handover meetings where people's progress was discussed and any concerns addressed. Staff told us the deputy manager and registered manager  participated in these handovers so they knew the status of people's care. When asked, several staff claimed  that they would be happy for a relative to be cared for at the service.  There was a proactive, innovative way of tackling difficult issues at the service. An example was with one  person where the care needs were being skewed by an external source. Despite constant criticism and at  times upsetting behaviour, the registered manager and deputy manager acted professionally and in the  interests of the person. This involved working jointly with a healthcare professional, including participation  in legal processes to ensure the person received the best possible care. Another example was the detection  and management of one staff member whose behaviour fell well below the professional standards required.  18 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  The service ensured safety of all concerned. They sent the staff member home in a taxi, checked people's  medicines, made a detailed report of the issue and referred the matter to a professional body. Via our  monitoring processes, we could see the wider public were protected from poor care practices by the action  the service took in relation to the single incident.  The service repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to quality care. The service had built strong and  reliable connections with the local community and multidisciplinary healthcare professionals. Examples  included the fortnightly pre-schoolers' visits with people who used the service. We heard that children and  people had engaged positively during the 'army wives' visits (a similar earlier project with children). People,  relatives and staff told us they ""loved"" having the children at the service. The children would sit with people  and talk to them, participate in activities together and ask questions of each other.   The service continued their commitment to research in the adult social care landscape. Since our last  inspection, the service had continued one project called 'care companion'. A unique system, designed in  England but piloted only at Sandown Park Care Home, staff used portable handsets to log hourly  information about each person. This included indicators such as a person's emotion, pain score, skin  integrity, hunger and thirst. The data was analysed by the computer to provide a baseline score of the  person's needs, and provide real-time monitoring which could be accessed by relatives from their home  computers or personal mobile phones. The intuitive system was able to determine when deterioration of a  person's condition was imminent, and send warnings to the staff. Staff could then reassess a person, call the GP for simple advice and prevent avoidable hospital admissions. The clinical commissioning group (CCG)  representative told us although the project had ended and the impact for people was extremely beneficial,  the service had decided to continue to use 'care companion'.   Another example of research was the probiotic study. Probiotics are natural bacteria that live in a person's  stomach and intestines. Only 20 care homes in England and Wales were selected to participate. The trial was to determine whether a daily capsule of probiotics would reduce the rate of chest infections, skin problems,  diarrhoea or constipation and mouth disorders. Fourteen people who used the service took part. Staff were  trained as 'champions' for the project and taught the remainder of the team the purpose and potential  benefits of the study. The staff then ensured adherence to the study protocols and documentation  requirements. Although the research was not complete, the results would be used to determine whether  there was a benefit for people who took daily probiotics. The information from the study would also be  published nationally and internationally for healthcare professionals to use in their own services.  The service had continued to use the CCG's 'hydration project' initiative. There is evidence that people who  drink more fluids have a decreased risk or development of urinary tract infections. Staff were appointed as  'champions' to ensure the principles of the hydration project were embedded to benefit people. These  included at least seven dedicated drinks rounds per day, frequent encouragement for people to take fluids  and additional support for people who needed help with drinks. We consistently saw people enjoying  drinks, and drinks offered to people. Some people had their favourite cups, including ones with movie  characters on the outside which could hold large volumes of fluids. The 'hydration stations' (fluid trolleys)  were brightly coloured and decorated in a Tropicana theme. We saw this included palm trees and flamingos. A large range of drinks was available for people, including fizzy waters and traditional flavours from the  1900's. We saw evidence that people did not develop urinary tract infections and communicated regularly  with the CCG to track their progress.  There was an underlying equality policy and procedure which staff were aware of. The provider also clearly  displayed this on their website and showed the principles they subscribed to. People were respected by staff regardless of their cultural, religious, or linguistic backgrounds. People's characteristics were protected by   19 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  staff and the management team. The registered manager also told us the principles applied to the  workforce and we observed this. Staff treated each other with respect and dignity. The kitchen staff had an  excellent knowledge of special dietary requirements and staff knew specific end of life regimes for different  cultures or religions. The service respected people's and visitors' gender and sexuality choices. Additionally,  the service had recently commenced a scheme with a European charity to offer work placements to younger adults with disabilities. The service had thoroughly assessed and implemented the principles of equality,  diversity and human rights in the provision of care and its daily operations.  A number of quality audits and checks were used to gauge the safety and quality of care. These were  completed according to an audit calendar set by the provider and included assessments from the service's  staff and management, regional support team, contractors and community healthcare partners. We saw  areas that were audited included the kitchen, laundry, maintenance and repairs, medicines, infection  prevention and control, staff training and recruitment, personal care and nursing documentation. The  calendar clearly set out who was responsible for each audit, and what month the check was to be  completed in. We reviewed some of the audits which were completed. There was a key performance  indicator report completed monthly aligned with criteria from the Care Quality Commission's five 'key  questions' The report populated an action plan which was required to be completed by the registered  manager. We saw any areas identified for improvement were always reviewed, and closed off with a  signature of the responsible staff member and the date.  There were times when the service was legally required to notify us of certain events which occurred. When  we spoke with the registered manager, they were able to explain the circumstances under which they would  send statutory notifications to us. We checked our records prior to the inspection and saw that the service  had notified us of relevant events. The service's prior inspection rating was clearly displayed in the reception area and on the provider's website.  20 Sandown Park Care Home Inspection report 27 February 2018  "

People in care homes receive accommodation and  personal care as single package under one contractual agreement. CQC regulates both the premises and the care provided and both were looked at during this inspection. The care home accommodates 12 people in  one adapted building.   The inspection took place on 30 January 2018 and was unannounced. At the previous inspection in January  2016 we identified one breach of regulations relating to 'Good Governance. ""Following the last inspection,  we asked the provider to complete an action plan to show what they would do and by when to ensure  compliance with the regulations.   At this inspection we found issues remained with the organisation, presence and relevance of  documentation.  Although we did not identify any significant risks to people, if appropriate and robust  documentation is not maintained there is the risk of unsafe of inconsistent care delivery.    A registered manager was in place. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  The registered manager and provider were very 'hands on' and provided highly person centred care.  There  was a dedication to ensuring people had fulfilling lives and the best possible care and support experience.   However the 'hands on' nature of the registered manager was at the detriment to maintaining appropriate  documentation, with a lack of administration support to carry out these duties.  This lack of robust  documentation meant the service could not consistently evidence safe, effective care and a well led service,  despite some really positive feedback about the service from people, relatives and staff and positive  interactions observed during the inspection.   People were safe from abuse living in the home. People said they felt safe and safeguarding procedures  were in place to help protect people. Whilst the staff we spoke with had a good understanding of each  person and the risks they presented, this was not always underpinned by robust and up-to-date risk  assessments which increased the risk of inconsistent or appropriate care.   The premises was maintained to a high standard with very pleasant fixtures and fittings and a warm and  homely feel. Key maintenance checks were undertaken in most areas, although we identified some  concerns relating to fire safety which we referred to the Fire Service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. However protocols were required to support the safe and consistent use of ""as required medicines""  2 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  There were enough staff deployed to ensure people received prompt care and support. Staff had time to  spend with people as well as completing care and support tasks. Recruitment procedures were in place but  documentation did not always evidence some of the recruitment decisions made.   Staff knew people well and were knowledgeable about the topics and questions we asked them about.  However staff training was not well organised and we were unable to evidence staff had received training in  a number of areas.   The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  Where people lacked capacity, decisions were made in their best interest.  There  was a culture of seeking consent before any care and support interventions.    The service worked effectively with a range of health professionals to meet people's individual needs.   Technology was utilised to help ensure care needs were met.   People had access to home cooked food which they said was of high quality.  People had a range of choices  which were adapted to people's individual needs.   Staff were extremely kind and caring and treated people with a high level of dignity and respect. There was a pleasant , family like atmosphere within the home. Staff knew people very well and chatted to them  throughout the day.    People's views and opinions were respected and acted on. People had a say in what went on within the  home, including the food, activities and décor. People's independence was promoted and several people  helped out around the home in order to achieve this.   People's care needs were assessed and a range of plans of care put in place. Whilst we saw appropriate care  was provided to people, care plans did not always reflect people's current needs. People received kind and  compassionate end of life care.   People had access to a range of activities and social opportunities. The service supported people to go out  into the community and access events and community gatherings.   People and relatives displayed a high level of satisfaction with the service. They said the management team  were approachable and listened to any issues or concerns they had.   There was a positive and visibly person centred culture within the home with people, relatives and staff all  saying they would recommending the home to others.     Improvements were needed to governance systems to ensure the service achieved compliance with the  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Audits ,checks  and improvements plans needed putting in place to help achieve this.   We found two breaches of the health and social care act 2008 (Regulated Activities) 2014 Regulations. You  can see what action was asked the provider to take at the back of the full version of this report.  3 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  "	  The service was not consistently safe.   People felt safe living in the home. However care and support  was not always underpinned by relevant and up-to-date risk  assessments to help promote consistently safe care.  Systems  were in place to protect people from abuse.   Overall medicines were safely managed and people received  their medicines as prescribed.   There were enough staff deployed to ensure people received  personalised care and support and assistance when they  required it.  Improvements were needed to recruitment practice  as documentation did not demonstrate that safe procedures  were consistently followed.    	  The service was not consistently effective.   The service needed to ensure it worked to recognised guidance  and legislation.  Staff had an in-depth knowledge of people they  supported. However training records were not always present  which meant the service was unable to evidence that staff had  received training in a range of areas.   People spoke positively about the food provided by the home. It  was home cooked and adapted to people's individual needs and requirements.   The service worked with a range of health professionals to help  ensure people's needs were met.   The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental  Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  	  The service was caring.   4 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Good    Good    Requires Improvement    People and relatives provided very positive feedback about the  caring nature of the staff and owners. This was confirmed by our  observations.   Staff knew people very well and had developed good positive  relationships with them. People's independence was promoted  by the service.   Care was person centred and people's views and opinions were  used to plan people's care and support.   	  The service was responsive.  People received personalised care that met their individual  needs. Peoples were supported to follow their interests and  participate in activities in the home and the wider community.   The service utilised technology to enhance people's care and  support experiences.   People were very satisfied with the service, but mechanisms were in place should people wish to raise any concerns or complaints.   People received individualised and compassionate end of life  care.   	  The service was not consistently well led.   Documentation relating to people's care and support and  training was not kept up-to-date. Improvements had not been  made in this area following the last inspection.   There was a strong, visible person centred culture within the  home.  People , relatives and staff provided very positive  feedback about the home.   People's views and feedback was used to improve the service  and enhance people's care experiences.   5 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018     The Cedars  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in January 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 30 January and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two  inspectors. During the inspection we spoke with six people who used the service and six visitors. We also  spoke with three care workers, the registered manager and provider. We observed care and support,  including the mealtime experience and looked around the home. We looked at three people's care records  and other records such as medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training  records and maintenance records.   Because some maintenance records were not available to us on the day  of the inspection, we requested these were sent to us after the inspection. The registered manager  forwarded the required documents onto us.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health care professional who works with the  service.   On this occasion we did not request a Provider Information Return from the provider. This is information we  require providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the  service does well and improvements they plan to make  6 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were kept safe from abuse and improper treatment. People told us they felt safe living in the home.  They told us staff were kind to them and always treated them well. One person said ""I feel so safe and secure here. It's always nice and warm and staff do everything they should to make sure you are ok."" Another  person described the home as, ""Homely, warm and cosy."" A relative told us, ""It always feels so warm and  homely. It's a home not an institution."" Staff were able to tell us how they would identify and act on  allegations of abuse to help keep people safe. We saw there had been no recent safeguarding incidents,  however, our discussion with the registered manager demonstrated they had a good understanding of  safeguarding processes, giving us assurance the correct procedures would be followed should an incident  occur.  Where finances were held on behalf of people, records were kept to provide a full audit trail of any  income and expenditure to protect people from financial abuse.    Whilst staff had a good understanding of the risks each person posed and how to keep them safe, this was  not always underpinned by robust and up-to-date risk assessment documents. We observed staff were  vigilant in ensuring people remained safe. For example, we saw staff reminding one person who was  standing up to remember to use their mobility aid. They also prompted another person to put their slippers  on before standing up to ensure they were wearing appropriate footwear to help reduce the risk of them  falling. During breakfast we saw one person, who lived with dementia, reach for the teapot to pour  themselves a drink, staff reminded them to pick the teapot up by the handle because the teapot contained  hot tea. This showed us staff were mindful of ensuring they promoted people's independence and freedom  in a safe and supportive way. We saw evidence the service liaised with care professionals and obtained  specialist equipment when people's needs changed, for example, in relation to skin integrity and falls.   Risk assessment documents demonstrated that although risks to people's health and safety were assessed  they were not always kept up-to-date. For example, one person's mobility had reduced and they needed  two staff to meet their moving and handling needs, with specific equipment. Although staff were clear on the plan of care, there was an absence of formal risk assessment stating how this would be done safely. This  person's skin risk assessment and care plan had also not been updated to show they now spent most of  their time in bed.   Nutritional risk screening tools and care plans were not always kept up-to-date following changes in  people's weights and care plans contained a lack of information on the measures needed to promote good  nutrition.  Whilst we saw care practices had been adapted following changes in people's needs, the absence  of up-to-date formal risk assessments and care plans had the potential for inconsistent and unsafe care to  occur. It also meant there was a lack of evidence the risks associated with each person's care had been  formally considered and assessed.   The provider did not have Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEPs) in place to instruct staff how to  safely evacuate people in the event of an emergency. Although staff knew people well, we were concerned  there were not appropriate processes in place to promptly and accurately inform the emergency services of  people's needs in the event of an emergency. The staff we spoke with told us they would check the fire panel  7 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  if the alarm sounded but could not tell us how they would tell the emergency services about people's needs  to ensure safe evacuation.  This demonstrated a lack of risk assessment in this area. Some fire maintenance  records were also not consistently in place. We made a referral to the local fire authority about these issues.   This was a breach of regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) 2014  Regulations.   We concluded there were enough staff to meet people's individual needs. People who used the service and  relatives told us staffing levels were appropriate, that they received prompt care and support and regular  interaction and companionship.  One person told us, ""Whenever I press my buzzer they are there like a  flash."" Another person told us, ""Staff are very attentive and come to you straight away if you ask for  something."" The registered manager told us the usual minimum staffing level were two carers during the  day and one carer at night. The registered manager lived above the home so were always on call and  regularly helped the care staff during the day. They also told us they were on call during the night and would  come down if the night carer required additional support. Care staff were supported by ancillary staff such  as the cook or cleaner. We observed care and saw people were provided with prompt assistance when  required. Staff had time to spend with people meeting their social needs as well as assisting with personal  care. We saw staff were unrushed and staff all told us there were enough of them to meet people's needs.   The registered manager told us they never used agency staff because they could not guarantee they would  work to the same high standards which they expected from their care staff. They told us unexpected  absences were covered by offering extra shifts to their regular staff. If staff could not pick up the shift then  they were always available and would work on the care rota. However, when we reviewed the care rotas we  saw that where the registered manager had worked a care shift they did not record this on the staff rota. This meant it was difficult to establish from reviewing the rotas that all care shifts had been appropriately  covered. We discussed this with the registered manager and they confirmed they would ensure a clear  record was kept of all care shifts they had worked so that they could appropriately evidence that  appropriate staffing levels had been maintained.   Overall, medicines were managed safely. Medicines were stored securely within locked cupboards and there was appropriate storage for controlled drugs. We observed a person centred approach to medicine  administration with senior care staff giving medicines to people at the times they required them. For  example, some people needed their medicines before food and arrangements were in place to ensure this  happened.  Medicine Administration Records (MAR) were in place which demonstrated people had received  their medicines as prescribed. Whilst we were able to account for most medicines, stock balances from the  previous month had not always been carried forward onto the current months MAR making reconciliation  difficult.  In addition, protocols were not in place for ""as required medicines"" such as pain relief instructing  staff on how to consistently offer these types of medicines. However, this risk was mitigated somewhat as  staff knew people well and how to identify if they needed these medicines. Safe arrangements were in place  for the application of topical medicines such as creams.   We saw a high standard of cleanliness throughout the home and we found no bad odours in any area. We  saw protective equipment was available and accessible to staff in key areas such as bathrooms and we saw  staff used these in an appropriate way to help reduce the spread of infection. We saw staff adhering to good  hygiene practices for example wearing personal protective equipment such as gloves and aprons  appropriately. A relative said, ""It doesn't smell its always as clean as you see it now.""  In November 2017, the  service had been awarded a five star rating for food hygiene by the Foods Standard authority, this is the  highest award that can be made and demonstrated food was prepared and stored hygienically.    8 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  Many of the staff employed had worked at the service for a number of years and there was therefore a low  turnover of staff. This meant people benefitted from consistent care from staff knowledgeable about their  needs and were able to build positive relationships with the people who cared for them.   We saw that the provider had undertaken checks to ensure the people they employed were safe and  suitable to work with vulnerable people. For example, they had sought references and carried out criminal  records checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) to make sure the applicants did not have a  criminal conviction which may have made them unsuitable to work with vulnerable people. However, we  found the processes followed were not always appropriately recorded. We saw one staff member had a  previous conviction. The registered manager was able to describe in detail what measures they had taken to ensure this would not impact upon their ability to safely care for people. However, they had not completed a formal process to document their rationale and risk assess this situation prior to employing them. The  registered manager said they would complete a thorough risk assessment as an immediate priority.  This  was forwarded onto us after the inspection.   In another staff file we saw a character reference from someone the staff member had previously worked  with. However, there was no reference from their last employer. The registered manager told us they had  requested the reference several times but had no response from their last employer. This had not been  recorded within the person's recruitment file. This meant the provider was unable to demonstrate they  consistently followed safe recruitment procedures.    When we looked around we saw the home had safety features such as radiator coverings to protect against  the risk of burns and window restrictors to reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that  key safety checks such as the gas and electrical systems were carried out  However, the office where  information was stored was disorganised and therefore it was difficult to locate many of the maintenance  records we requested. These were all sent to us following the inspection.   Accidents and incidents were recorded and we saw evidence that action was taken including liaising with  health professionals and ordering equipment following incidents such as falls. When things went wrong  lessons were learnt for example we were told one person became stuck in the bath after the batteries on the  hoist ran out. We saw a new procedure had been put in place to reduce the likelihood this would re-occur.  The registered manager, owner and staff were committed to improving people's experiences and taken  action to reduce the likelihood of adverse events.  9 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We found people's care needs were met by the service, this was achieved through close consultation with  people and their relatives and close monitoring of people's care experiences. However, the service did not  always seek and work to recognised guidance particularly in terms of ensuring the required documentation  and protocols were in place to underpin consistently safe and effective care.   We recommend the provider accesses guidance and support to help ensure they can evidence care is  consistently delivered in line with current legislation and evidence based guidance.   People provided excellent feedback about the staff who cared for them and said they were equipped with  the skills and knowledge to properly support them. Many of the staff had been at the service for several years and knew people very well. The registered manager was selective about the staff they employed to ensure  they worked to a consistent high standard. This helped ensure effective care.     Staff received a mixture of ongoing training including classroom training by external training providers,  online training and some hands on training delivered by the registered manager. However, we were unable  to evidence from the records available that all staff had completed appropriate training in key topics, such  as, safeguarding. Although the registered manager assured us that all staff completed regular training in  these areas and staff were able to talk speak confidently about these topics, we were concerned that  without an accurate and centralised training log the registered manager would be unable to effectively  monitor staff training. This issue had also been identified at the previous inspection.   This was a breach of regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act (2008) Regulated Activities 2014  Regulations.   New staff received an in house induction which included an overview of key internal policies and procedures such as fire safety and pressure area care. They also completed a number of shadow shifts until the  registered manager judged that they were competent to work independently. Staff who were new to care  were supported to undertake the Care Certificate. This is a nationally recognised training programme  designed to give staff new to care the knowledge and skills they need to deliver safe and effective care. We  spoke with a staff member who had recently completed this and they told us they found it a helpful  introduction to care. However, they said they found the 'on the job' training delivered by the registered  manager to be the most useful to ensure they could meet the individual needs of people who lived at the  home. They told us, ""They showed me precisely how to deliver appropriate personal care and pressure area  care to people. She taught me so much and how to ensure all the care we deliver is personalised to each  individual person's needs and requirements.""  The registered manager did not complete regular supervisions or appraisals with their staff. However, they  said they operated an open door policy where staff could come to them at any time to raise issues. They  also regularly worked alongside their staff on care shifts so explained they were able to monitor and address any poor quality care practices or training needs. This was confirmed by the staff we spoke with. One staff   10 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  member told us, ""You can go to the manager whenever you need anything, they will never turn you away or  make you feel like you are asking a stupid question."" Another staff member told us, ""I feel really well  supported, I don't have formal supervisions but I don't need one as I speak to [registered manager's name]  every day anyway and they always act on what I tell them or ask for.""  People who used the service and relatives provided good feedback about the food provided. One person  told us, ""The food is really good and excellent quality."" Another person told us, ""I am always full, we never go hungry, they are always trying to feed us."" A third person said ""The main meal is extremely good always fruit  and drink out and tea."" A relative said, ""The food smells beautiful and always looks nice on the plate."" All  food was home cooked by the cook or in the absence the provider assisted. People had a good choice of  food which rotated on a four weekly menu and individual requests were catered for. Food was fortified and  people were provided with additional snacks to maintain good nutrition.   We saw that mealtimes were a relaxed and social occasion for people. Staff were attentive to the little  details to ensure mealtimes were an individualised experience. For example, during breakfast everyone was  given several food options including hot and cold items, juices and hot drinks. Where people ordered hot  drinks we saw this was provided in an individual teapot with sugar and milk so the person could help  themselves. At lunchtime there was a lovely atmosphere with people talking amongst themselves and to  staff.   People's nutritional needs were assessed and staff were knowledgably about people's needs, although care  plan documentation and risk assessments did not always reflect this knowledge.  People were weighed  regularly, however, this information was not always used to update care plans. We saw one person had two  different weights recorded on the same day with no explanation within the records as to which one was  correct.   We concluded the service worked effectively with other healthcare professionals to help meet people's  needs.  People told us they could see a health professional whenever they wanted to. One person told us, ""If  I am unwell they take great care of you, they don't hesitate to call the doctor to make sure you get what you  need. I get everything I need living here and more."" A relative told us, ""They cope well with changes in needs  and getting the doctors involved."" They went onto say that contact with health professionals was ""very  good."" We spoke with a health care professional who said the service listened to their advice and contacted  them appropriate. They said they had no concerns over care at The Cedars.   Where people's needs had deteriorated and they needed more complex care and support for example with  moving and handling, appropriate professionals such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists had  been contacted, although this was not always evidenced through care records. Relatives said they were kept informed and involved when people's needs changed.  The service was complaint with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DolS). The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making  particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act  requires that, as far as possible, people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed.  When they lack mental capacity to take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best  interests and as least restrictive as possible.   People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this is in their  best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care homes  and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  11 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. At the time of the inspection there  were no DoLS in place. One authorisation had expired and had been re-applied for within the appropriate  timescale but had not yet been reviewed by the supervisory body. The registered manager explained that  they had considered DoLS applications for others but many people had capacity to consent to their care  and support and they didn't believe the restrictions placed on others amounted to a deprivation of liberty  safeguards. However, this rational could have been better supported through care plan documentation.    We saw evidence people's relatives and health professionals were consulted over best interest decisions  and people were involved in decision making to the maximum extent possible. Staff explained choices to  people and waited for people's permission before proceeding with care tasks.  For example, prior to lunch we observed staff encouraging one person to go to the bathroom. The person  told them they did not want to go yet so staff left them for several minutes. When staff returned they asked  the person if they wanted to go to the bathroom yet and when the person said they were ready, staff  supported the person to stand and walk using their walking frame. Throughout this process staff provided  the person with appropriate encouragement, reassurance and explained each step so the person  understood what was happening. This demonstrated staff recognised the importance of consent.   The building was pleasantly decorated and finished to a high standard. People had been fully involved in  redecoration of the premises for example being consulted over the colour of décor and carpets. We  concluded the building was appropriately adapted for the needs of people using the service. The registered  manager demonstrated that as part of the pre-assessment process for new residents they thought carefully  about the building and its limitation in terms of space before determining whether they could meet any new  people's needs.    12 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People's feedback about staff was overwhelmingly positive. Everyone we spoke with told us staff were kind,  caring, friendly and compassionate. This extended to the provider and registered manager who were very  involved in providing care and support. One person told us, ""It's a home from home here. Staff treat you as if  you were a member of their own family. It's like a piece of heaven. I don't ever want to leave."" Another  person told us, ""It's one of the best places you could ever imagine, it's fantastic, wonderful."" A visitor told us,  ""The care people receive here is second to none, I would love to live here."" Another visitor said, ""Always feel  very welcome, lovely manner how the staff treat them."" A third visitor said, ""Friendly and well-mannered  staff, all staff nice."" A fourth visitor told us how impressed they were with the constant interaction between  staff and people which made for a friendly and family atmosphere.    People's views were also supported by our observations. Everyone was given a warm welcome as they  arrived in the lounge area in the morning.  We saw people received personalised care. For example, on the  day of our inspection it was a person's birthday. Staff had arranged for the hairdresser to come in to do their  hair. Staff really made a fuss of them when they came back from the hairdressers telling them how lovely  they looked. We could tell from the smiles and positive body language that this really made the person feel  happy. Staff also arranged a tea party so the person could celebrate their birthday with all the people who  lived at the home. Staff decorated the dining room and got out party plates, cups and serviettes to make the  event special. The cook asked the person if they wanted to come to the supermarket to choose the food  they wanted for their party. They said they did and went with the cook to choose exactly what they wanted.  There was a homely and relaxed atmosphere in the home. We observed lots of laughter and appropriate  and respectful fun and banter between people who lived at the home and staff. One person told us, ""Staff  are full of fun and keep us well entertained."" Another person told us, ""I don't normally like being away from  home for Christmas but I really enjoyed it here. Staff made it a real celebration.""  Staff were also complimentary about the quality of care provided. One staff member told us, ""The care  delivered here is really exceptional. I would be happy for any of my relatives to come to live here if they  needed to.""   Our observations and discussions with staff showed they knew people well and had developed strong  positive relationships with each person.  Staff had time to sit and chat with people, meeting their social  needs. However, despite having this knowledge we saw staff were mindful to promote people's individual  choice and independence. For example, during breakfast when staff offered people a choice they prompted  them with what the person usually enjoyed for breakfast but were also clear about what other options were  available on the menu. This helped people to make an informed decision about what they wanted to eat  that day. We saw people were able to do as they pleased. For example, they could get up and go to bed  when they wanted. One person said, ""You can do as you like, get up late and have a lazy day if you want.""   Another person told us, ""I like to go out for little walks as I love the fresh air, staff let me go out whenever I  like. They make sure I am ok and remind me to wrap up warm but I can go into town whenever I want to,  which is nice as that's something I have always liked to do.""  13 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We also saw that staff encouraged people to maintain their independence, for example, one person was  supported and encouraged to open their own post during our visit. Other people helped set tables and  assisted with the washing up.   People were encouraged to develop and maintain relationships. Visitors were able to visit the home when  they wanted and given a warm welcome with the offer of food and drinks. One person told us that their  partner visited twice a week and the home cooked meals for them so they could eat and spend time  together. Staff also supported people to attend hospital appointments if no family were available to take  them. This was done free of charge which demonstrated a caring service.   We also saw that staff spoke about this being a 'house' and were mindful to respect people's personal  space, privacy and dignity. For example, in the communal lounge we saw multiple examples of staff  encouraging people to be supported to go to the bathroom. This was always done in a discreet and  respectful manner.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the manager, staff, people and  visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service. The provider promoted a positive  and inclusive care ethos which put person centred care at the heart of care delivery. We saw staff were  focussed on empowering people to make decisions about their care. Adjustments were made to care and  support to cater for people's diverse needs, for example, ensuring appropriate equipment was in place to  help where people had a physical disability.   14 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives all praised the standard of care provided. They said it was of a consistently high quality  and met people's individual needs. A relative said , ""It's absolutely fantastic here. Superb, if I had to go to a  home I would come here, very homely."" Another relative said, ""Excellent care, more than happy with the  home, it's more like a family, they feed them and look after them.""  People told us the care delivered was highly personalised. One relative told us, ""It's the little things that staff  do which make all the difference. For example, they don't just dress people. They ask what they want to  wear and ensure the clothes are clean and co-ordinated. They are attentive to the little details like  remembering my relatives pearl necklace, earrings and helping to paint their nails. It shows the staff really  do care and take time to ensure each person feels special.""  Our observations confirmed staff had taken  their time and paid attention to detail when assisting people with their personal care.  We saw that people's  clothing was clean and co-ordinated and people had clearly been supported to brush their hair and clean  their teeth. Staff had also asked people if they wanted to wear their jewellery and made sure people's  spectacles were clean and reminded them to wear them. We saw one person was wearing an apron. We  asked them about that. They told us they were never without an apron when they were at home and that  they felt ""lost"" without it on. They told us staff had asked them if they wanted to wear their apron and  ensured it was regularly laundered.   Prior to admission, the registered manager completed an assessment to ensure they could meet people's  needs. They considered whether the home's environment, equipment and current residents were  compatible with the person's needs. People were invited to look around and join the other residents for a  meal if they wished to see if they liked the home. This allowed all parties to get to know each other and  make an informed decision as to whether the placement was right. This helped ensure people's needs could be met as soon as they moved into the home.    The service had recently moved over to an electronic care record system. We saw a range of care plans were  in place for areas covering communication, continence, personal care and skin integrity. These were subject  to updates, however, these were not consistently updated which meant they did not always demonstrate  the latest plan of care. Whilst this risk was mitigated somewhat by the small size of the service and  knowledge of staff, action was needed to bring these plans up-to-date.   People and relatives said they felt involved in care and support. We saw people and relatives were consulted on a regular basis for example if their needs changed and they needed specific equipment or interventions  from other healthcare professionals.    The service had utilised technology to help meet people's individual needs. The service used the  telemedicine scheme run by a local hospital trust. Telemedicine provides remote video consultations  between hospital nursing staff and the home. It helps support care outside hospital, including avoiding  unnecessary visits and admissions to hospital. A new electronic call monitoring system had been introduced which monitored response times and allowed management to review whether people were waiting long for   15 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  assistance. Assistive technology such as pressure mats were used to help reduce the risk of falls in the home. The manager told us they were planning to introduce voice recognition devices around the home to allow  people to have more control over their living environment, for example, allowing them to request certain  music to play. This was an excellent opportunity to involve people in how the home operated.    We saw staff regularly engaged people in meaningful and appropriate occupation. One person told us they  really enjoyed the entertainers who came into the home, particularly the singers and musicians. Another  person told us they had always enjoyed keeping the home clean and tidy. During the inspection we saw they spent some time in the kitchen helping staff to wash up. They told us this was something they really enjoyed  doing and helped to keep their ""mind active."" We also saw that during the afternoon staff got out a variety of games and puzzles which people played alongside whilst having a drink of sherry. People enjoyed playing  these and provided a good chance for staff, people and visitors to interact and have fun together. One  regular visitor told us, ""Staff go the extra mile to ensure they keep people really well entertained here.""  The service helped people maintain links with the local community. The provider took people out to the  shops and to local café's and the service assisted people attend community events. Nursery children visited  the home once a week to interact with the residents. People's spiritual needs were assessed and the service  worked with people to meet these needs. One person who had recently moved into the home told us staff  had supported them to attend a local Church. They told us their faith had always been a very important part  of their life and they were looking forward to being able to continually attend the local Church now that they lived at the home  None of the people who used the service, visitors or relatives told us anything negative about the service or  the standard of care provided. People said they would feel able to make a complaint if they had a concern.  They told us they would tell staff or the manager directly if they had an issue and were confident they would  be listened to. There was a formal complaints process in place which was provided to people when they  moved into the home as part of the service user guide. The registered manager told us they had not received any formal complaints from people who used the service or their relatives in the past 18 months.  A  significant number of compliments had been received by the home with people and relatives having  positive experiences of the service.   The service worked with other professionals to ensure people's end of life needs were met. We saw the  service worked with professionals to ensure anticipatory medicines were in place and some staff had  received training in end of life care. We spoke with two relatives about their experience of the care being  provided to their relatives as they reached the end of their lives. Both were positive. One told us, ""Staff are  really sensitive and so tender with my relative. They know it's a difficult time for us and make everything as  easy and compassionate as they can. We are so pleased we have found it here, the care is just excellent and  we know longer have to worry."" We spoke with a relative who said that the end of life care provided by the  home was attentive and to a high standard. However, care documentation detailing end of life  arrangements needed to be more robust.   16 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   Although we recognised the home was small and there was a high level of management presence;  documentation relating to people's care and support and the management of the service was not always  present or sufficiently robust. We did not find this impacted on people in a negative way, but there was a risk it would should robust risk assessments, care records and other systems not be maintained in the future.   Whilst the registered manager was open and honest with us and recognised improvements were needed to  aspects of documentation, the same issues were also present at the last inspection which demonstrated a  lack of action taken to act on risks that we previously identified.   For example, at the last inspection we found it was difficult to establish whether staff had received training  There was no collation of the training staff had received, and at times it was difficult to establish when staff  last had training updates in subjects. There was no defined policy or criteria for how often training updates  were required in various subjects, which had resulted in staff receiving updates at inconsistent intervals.  Training was not underpinned by any training needs analysis or formal assessment of staff skill.  This was  still the case at this inspection.   Care plans were not always reviewed and updated regularly which meant information within them did not  reflect people's current needs. There was no system to periodically audit and check care records to ensure  they were maintained to a high quality.  There was no overall system to monitor and check compliance with  the regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities 2014) Regulations.    Following our last inspection the registered manager had employed an administrative assistant to support  them to get on top of the paperwork. However, the administrator had left after four months because they  wanted to pursue an alternative career. Since then the post had been advertised but they had failed to find  the right person to fill the role. This meant the registered manager did not have additional support to ensure they kept on top of administrative tasks and record keeping particularly as they prioritised being 'hands on'  delivering care and support.   This was a breach of regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities 2014)  regulations.   A registered manager was in place. We found the required notifications had been submitted to us such as  any deaths which helped us monitor events occurring within the service. Feedback about the home and  quality of care provided was consistently good from people , relatives and staff. They all said they would  recommend the home to others. A staff member said it's a small friendly home,  I love it, you interact more  with people."" A person said of the provider and registered manager ""They are goodness of good, this place is marvellous. ""The feedback about the registered manager was overwhelmingly positive. One staff member  told us, ""I can approach [registered manager's name] about anything. I wouldn't hesitate to go to them if I  had a problem as I know they would act on it.""  17 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded that the registered manager had exceptionally high standards and promoted the ethos that  staff should always deliver high quality and personalised care. We noticed that staff did not call the service a  'care home' but referred to it as a 'house.' We asked staff about this. One staff member told us, ""We call it a  house because that makes you think that everything you do and the care you provide should be the same  high standards you would give to a member of your own family. We always treat people who live here as  family and respect that this is their home.""  The registered manager and owner were very hands on and this  combined with the small size of the home meant they had an in-depth knowledge of how the home  operated, people's needs and their likes and dislikes. This helped ensure a very person centred culture.  It  was clear they were very dedicated to ensure people's experience in the home was as positive as possible.   The provider sent out annual quality questionnaires to people who used the service and their relatives. We  reviewed the returned questionnaires completed by people in August 2017. All of the feedback provided was extremely positive and there were no suggestions about anything which people felt needed to change or be  improved. However, the registered manager said they reviewed every response and if there had been any  suggestions they would implement any suggested changes wherever possible.  The service sought people's  views and feedback in all areas of the home for example menu's were consistently revised based on  people's requests and their feedback about the food.  People were fully consulted over activities and new  décor.     For example, a new carpet was required in the lounge area.  People were asked what type of carpet they  wanted and they said they wanted an exact replicate of the current carpet. The provider and manager went  to some effort to source the same carpet taking samples to a number of shops.  This showed the service was  committed to acting on people's views and feedback.    We saw some evidence the service learnt from incidents and adverse events to improve safety and the  manager was dedicated to improving people's involvement and care experience for example through the  use of technology.  However, the service had not acted on our feedback following the last inspection and  needed to put in place management plans to improve its governance systems and processes.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including health and social care professionals to provide  appropriate care for people. We saw good relationships had been developed and maintained with these  professionals.   18 The Cedars Inspection report 19 March 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

At the last inspection Hoyland Hall was rated as requires improvement and identified two breaches which  related to premises and equipment and good governance.  Following the last inspection, we asked the  provider to complete an action plan to show what they would do and by when to improve the premises and  governance to at least good. During this inspection we found improvements had been made to the premises but there were further breaches of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 associated regulations.  Hoyland Hall is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or personal care  as single package. CQC regulates both the premises and the care provided, and both were looked at during  this inspection. Hoyland Hall has two floors with living accommodation on both floors which is accessible by lift. The premises had undergone some refurbishment and included large accessible wet rooms on each  floor. There were 28 people living in the home on the days we inspected.  There was a registered manager in post. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care  Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  People and their relatives told us they felt safe and happy in Hoyland Hall. Staff knew how to report  safeguarding concerns and we saw appropriate follow up action was taken.  Risk assessments did not always reflect current need or provide staff with the necessary guidance to support people safely. Risks were not always mitigated based on individual need. Personal emergency evacuation  plans had incorrect information and some staff were not aware of how to use fire safety equipment. Fire  drills were not conducted regularly enough.  We observed poor moving and handling practice which did not mirror people's assessed need, and records  did not show how people's needs had changed over time. We saw all equipment had been checked in line  with Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 and other premises safety checks had been  completed as necessary. However, there was no other evidence of any equipment checks taking place on  the hoist or slings.  There was a mixed view of staffing levels as some people felt their needs were met promptly but others did  not. We observed staff were continuously busy with specific tasks and this meant peoples sometimes had to  wait.  Medicines were administered, stored and recorded safely and infection control practices were robust. The  home was clean and odour free.  2 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  All staff had received an induction, supervision and training although this needed further consideration due  to staff's lack of dementia awareness.  People were not always supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff did not  always support them in the least restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service did not  support this practice. The registered manager did not have current information about people's Deprivation  of Liberty Safeguards or their relevant conditions.  We did not observe positive mealtime experiences for people as they were waiting too long for food to be  served, were not offered a choice of meal or beverage, records did not always show people's current dietary  requirements and people who needed support did not receive this effectively.   We found people accessed health and social care services as needed.  The lounges were not conducive to social interaction and the premises were very cold on the first day, which had been remedied by the second day of the inspection.  Staff were considerate and caring towards people and respected people's privacy and dignity.  Care records were person-centred in style but had not been updated since 2015 in many cases. Although  they were reviewed on a monthly basis this evaluation did not incorporate people's changed needs.  There was limited social interaction, partly due to the layout and because staff did not have time to provide  extra support. We saw the registered manager had tried different options but people were reluctant to  engage.  People and staff told they enjoyed living and working at Hoyland Hall. However, we found there was not a  clear vision for the home and there was a lack of quality assurance measures in place from which to assess  the effectiveness of care delivery. The provider visited regularly but their visits did not evidence robust  scrutiny of documentation but focused on people's experiences and the atmosphere in the home which was very welcoming.  We found breaches of regulations in regards to person-centred care, the need for consent, safe care and  treatment and a further breach of good governance. We have made a recommendation about the review of  staffing levels.  You can see what action we told the provider to take at the back of the full version of the report.  3 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Good    We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not always safe.  Risks were not always managed effectively and staff did not  always follow safe practice. People sometimes had to wait for  staff attention.  People told us they felt safe and staff knew how to report  concerns.   Medication was managed safely.  	  The service was not always effective.  People had poor mealtime experiences due to a lack of choice,  interaction and time waiting for food. The home layout did not  promote social interaction.  The registered manager could not evidence all Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards had been adhered to properly and not all  people had the required capacity assessments in place.  Staff had received supervision and training to support them in  their roles and people accessed external health services when  needed.  	  The service was caring.  Staff displayed consideration and kindness to all people living in  the home and relatives and visitors spoke positively of the  welcoming atmosphere.  Staff knew people well and were able to discuss relevant topics  with them.  Privacy and dignity was respected and promoted.  	  Requires Improvement    4 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  The service was not always responsive.  Care records, although person-centred in style, did not always  reflect current need.  There were minimal organised activities.  Complaints were considered and responded to promptly.  	  The service was not always well led.  Although people and staff spoke highly of the registered  manager, there was little evidence to support effective  governance. There were no systems in place to monitor or  improve safe care delivery and the vision for the home was  limited.  People and their relatives were involved in discussions in the  home and there was evidence of positive partnership working.  Requires Improvement    5 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018     Hoyland Hall Residential  Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 6 and 13 November 2017 and was unannounced on both days. The inspection  team consisted of two adult social care inspectors on the first day and an expert by experience. An expert- by-experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of  care service. On the second day the service was inspected by one adult social care inspector.  Before the inspection we requested a Provider Information Return (PIR) which was returned to us. This is a  form that asks the provider to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and  improvements they plan to make. We checked information held by the local authority safeguarding and  commissioning teams in addition to other partner agencies and intelligence received by the Care Quality  Commission.  We spoke with seven people using the service and seven of their relatives. In addition, we spoke with nine  staff including four care workers, two kitchen assistants, the cook, a member of the domestic team and the  registered manager.  We looked at eight care records including risk assessments, four staff records including all training records,  minutes of resident and staff meetings, complaints, safeguarding records, accident logs, medicine  administration records and quality assurance documentation.  6 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018   	  Requires Improvement  	"   The people we spoke with at Hoyland Hall told us that they felt safe.  One person told us, ""If I didn't feel safe  I'd tell [name]. They're a good carer."" They also said, ""I have a latch on my door and I can use it if I have to.""  One relative said, ""You could have knocked us over with a feather when they told us they'd rather stay here.  They used to say they'd come into one of these places over their dead body, so they must feel safe to have  chosen to stay here.""  Another relative told us, ""They are safe here. They press the buzzer and staff come and see to them.""  Staff demonstrated a good understanding of what constituted abuse and how they would report this. One  care worker told us, ""It could be physical or verbal. If I had any concerns regarding a member of staff I would  tell the manager; if it was the manager I would tell the Care Quality Commission."" Another staff member told  us they had never seen anything of concern regarding the conduct of other staff members but would happily report it if they did. We looked at safeguarding records and saw there was one safeguarding issue in 2017,  which had been investigated and completed. However, we did not always see the outcomes were then  implemented as learning points.    We observed some poor moving and handling practice. One person who was unable to safely weight bear  was transferred from a comfortable chair into a wheelchair using a handling belt and turntable. However, as  this person was not able to support themselves this placed considerable strain on both care staff and had  the potential to harm the person as their weight was being completely taken by the care staff.   Another person was also moved using the same equipment but was unable to follow directions from the  staff, and one care worker commented, ""They always step off it"" referring to the turntable. Once they were in  the dining room chair, the chair was then pulled by two staff up to the table, again placing care staff at risk of injury. This should have highlighted this method of transfer was no longer safe for this person and yet it  continued to be used until we spoke with the registered manager. A further person whose record said they  were to be hoisted was transferred from a wheelchair into a comfortable chair in the lounge with two staff  using a handling belt and turntable. This meant staff were not adhering to the moving and handling plan.   Staff told us five people needed a hoist to transfer safely and one care worker said, ""It can take up to twenty  minutes to hoist one person. If we had one more person (care worker) it would help a lot."" We observed  transfers using the hoist were safely managed although noted the same sling was used for two different  people which posed an infection control risk. One care worker told us there was only one hoist in the home  and staff were unclear what they would do if it broke down. People were not always spoken with during the transfers as staff concentrated on the procedure which  meant those who had memory problems were unaware what was happening to them. We also saw brakes  were not always applied to wheelchairs when people were being transferred into them, meaning there was a risk the wheelchair could move.  Moving and handling risk assessments were contradictory for some people as in one record we saw  ""assisted to complete a stand transfer or to be hoisted."" There was no methodology for staff to follow or   7 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  details of the specific equipment people used. Some risk assessments had been completed initially in 2015  and not updated to reflect current need. The monthly evaluations did not consider this either.   We asked the registered manager who assessed people's moving and handling needs and they advised us it  was them. When we questioned why the person who should have been hoisted was not, they advised us this was because they had recently seen the physiotherapist who said using a handling belt was acceptable if  they were taking their weight. We observed this person was unable to take their weight and could not find  any notes in the person's care record to confirm this approach. Although the registered manager was able to describe safe moving and handling techniques, we did not always observe this in practice. This is a breach of Regulation 12 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 safe care and  treatment as people were being placed at risk of harm by unsafe methods of transfer and inconsistent  practice.  Accidents and incidents were logged with details of what happened and whether any injury was incurred.  Different prevention measures were considered such as bed rails and comments were noted where these  would not be appropriate. Other risk assessments included skin integrity, specialist equipment, mobility and nutrition.  As with the moving and handling records, although these were reviewed on a monthly basis, they  were not always updated to reflect change in need. Risk reduction measures were generic rather than  person-specific such as checking for hazards and fit of footwear.  The emergency evacuation list was not up to date as some people had moved rooms. We spoke with the  registered manager on the first day of the inspection and they agreed to update it. However, on the second  day the same list was still on display in the medication room. Some of the details on the list were also  incorrect as one person was listed as needing two staff to help them stand and assist into a wheelchair and  yet this person was hoisted. People's personal emergency evacuation plans were not dated which made it  difficult to assess the validity of the information. This is a breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 good governance as records were insufficient to mitigate the  risks to people in the event of a serious incident.  There was mixed feedback about the response times of staff. One person said, ""It's champion here, you  press that buzzer, it lights up, and they're here in about two minutes, none of this waiting about lark"" and  another told us, ""I press my buzzer and they come. I don't have to wait a long time and that's at weekends  and in the evening too."" A further person spoke very positively of the staff, saying how prompt they were  answering the buzzer. One relative told us, ""There's always staff around. They always make time to discuss  any issues.""  On the first day we inspected one senior care worker and three care workers were on duty in the morning  but this reduced to one senior and two care workers in the afternoon. This was confirmed as a usual staffing  ratio by care workers. One care worker told us, ""It would help if we had more staff as we would get a proper  break."" We looked at staffing rotas and found all shifts were covered as required. The registered manager  explained they did not use a dependency tool as they based their ratio on knowing the needs of the people  without this. They said there were always three staff on duty at night and some staff worked split shifts  whereas others worked twelve hour days. However, our observations of care delivery showed, at times,  people were having to wait and the deployment of staff was not always most effective. We recommend the  registered manager regularly reviews staffing levels and adapts them to people's changing needs.  We looked at staff recruitment records and found appropriate checks had taken place. References were  obtained and Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) Checks completed. The DBS helps employers make safer  recruitment decisions and reduces the risk of unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups.  8 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  We looked at medication practice. One person said, ""Don't talk to me about tablets, I must be on about 30 a  day! I'm taking 8, 9, 10 at a time, but I'll say this, they [the care team] always get them for me and bring 'em  to me on time, morning and evening. They know they've got to for things such as my diabetes and stuff."" We  observed medication being administered safely and people were supported patiently ensuring all  medication had been swallowed before signing to say it had been administered. The medication room was  kept locked with access only by permitted staff, and we saw the room and fridge temperatures were  recorded and within required guidelines. Staff had had their medication competency checked at regular  intervals by the registered manager and learning was shared from audits completed internally and  externally.  Controlled drugs were stored appropriately and stock levels tallied with the records. Creams and other  medication not dispensed from a dosette box had the date of opening recorded on it to ensure it was not  used past its expiry date. The senior care worker responsible for medication fully understood the reason for  the timing of specific medication, such as early morning medication to be taken before food. No one in the  home was receiving any medication covertly. We did not see specific PRN (as required) protocols in place  but when we questioned the registered manager they told us only one person was on PRN medication and  they would resolve this immediately.   We saw all equipment had been checked in line with Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations  1998 and other premises safety checks had been completed as necessary. However, when we looked at fire  safety records we found much of these were incomplete and there was no evidence of any recent fire drills.  One care worker had no understanding as to how to use the evacuation sledge. When we discussed this with the registered manager they said they had completed one fire drill since August 2016 but there was no  written record of this. They did complete one in the period before the second day of our inspection to  ensure all new staff were familiar with the process.  Hoyland Hall was cold on the first day of the inspection and we took the temperature in two places, one  read 17 degrees centigrade in the dining room at 5.20pm and it was 18 degrees centigrade in the upstairs  corridor at 5.40pm. People were observed sitting with blankets wrapped around them in the lounges and  one person sitting in the dining room having breakfast on 6 November 2017 commented ""It's cold in here.""  Mid-morning we heard one person say to their neighbour, ""It's not very warm in here."" Further comments  were heard throughout the first day. One relative told us, ""The only thing I would say is it could be a bit  warmer."" They had brought in a blanket for their relation as they were so concerned about the temperature.  There were two convector fires in the lounges, one of which was blowing out cool air. The registered  manager agreed to ensure the heating was turned up. On the second day of the inspection, it was much  warmer in the home.  We saw a large part of the wall in the lounge had exposed plasterwork. The door between the kitchen and  the dining room also banged very loudly and one person commented, ""bang, bang, bang"" while eating their  dinner. We could not find any evidence these issues had been logged in a maintenance file.  We observed safe infection control practices including the use of personal protective clothing.  9 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We asked people if they felt staff were confident in their roles. One person said, ""Overall I'm happy, no doubt  about it. The staff know what they are doing."" One relative told us, ""The staff work well together and know  [name] well, I've no grumbles.""  Staff received an induction which included core training. We looked at supervision records and staff told us  they had received sessions which they read and signed. The registered manager said, ""Staff have supervision a month after they start and then two-three monthly afterwards. As many staff have been here a while some  only have it every six months. They also have an annual appraisal."" Staff received positive comments about  their performance including, ""[Name] leaves no stone unturned"" and ""Always informs staff of work  required."" We also saw evidence where particular issues had been identified, staff received targeted  supervision to address these and they were monitored following this.   Staff spoke positively of the training they received which was thorough. One care worker told us they were  currently completing a series of workbooks around infection control and they were interesting. Other topics  included safeguarding and mental capacity. Staff had undertaken training in emergency aid, moving and  handling, food safety, safeguarding, mental capacity and infection control. Not all staff we spoke with had  completed fire training in regards to the use of the evacuation sledge or displayed understanding of how to  support people living with dementia appropriately which showed in some of the interactions we observed  between staff and people living in the home where people were not addressed directly during moving and  handling transfers for example.  One person told us, ""The food is good here and there's plenty of it."" We saw portion sizes were sufficient.  However, we observed poor mealtime experiences for people. During the breakfast period we saw two  people given bowls of porridge without any explanation and this was left in front of them. They were not  encouraged to eat it and no staff offered to support initially as they were  occupied moving people into the  dining room. Another person had three Weetabix in front of them and although a care worker sat down to  support them to eat it, the person was not told what it was, the spoon was just placed near their mouth. In  this person's care record it was recorded, 'staff need to sit at the side of [name] and inform them what is on  their plate, and make sure their food is cut into bite-sized pieces'.   During the mid-morning drinks round on both days, people were given tea and no one was asked if they  would like an alternative. Again, we observed people were given drinks but were not advised what they were  or supported to drink them. We were told by a care worker two people had thickener added to their drinks to prevent choking, however, this was only recorded on the dietary requirements list for one person. When we  checked one person's care record we found their nutritional care plan did not reflect the need for thickener  in their drink. This was only recorded on a monthly review referring to Speech and Language Therapy (SALT)  advice received at the time. Another person's dietary intake care plan written in 2015 did not evidence new  advice received from the SALT team in June 2017 where it noted the person was to have only soft options.  People were taken to the dining room a long time before any food was served. People were encouraged to   10 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  move into the dining room at 11.40am and yet no food was served for a further 40 minutes. When we asked  the cook why people were not being given food we were told, ""We are waiting until more tables are full."" One person who needed assistance with their meal was not given any food until 12.40pm and then they  proceeded to eat with their fingers as no staff were around to support. Other people were not brought to the dining table until 12.50pm and then had to wait for support. The care worker did not tell people what was on their fork as they were assisting two people at the same time. One person pointed to two things on their  plate and said, ""I don't want those"" to the cook and was told ""You like mash. Eat what you want and leave  the rest."" This person was no offered an alternative. As with the beginning of the meal, people had to wait to  move into the lounge after they had finished their meal as there were not enough available staff available to  ensure safe transfers.  The three members of the care team focused on bringing people into the dining room and meals were  served by the catering staff with little meaningful engagement. Initially it appeared that the only meal on  offer was fish cakes, mashed potatoes, peas and white sauce. This was pre-plated and placed in front of  people without any discussion or acknowledgement. People's preferences were not checked to see if they  were happy with the meal choice and people with visual or cognitive impairment were not advised what was on the plate. We saw later there was also minced beef pie, boiled potatoes, peas and gravy on the menu  which some people were given without any discussion. The pudding of sponge and custard was also placed  in front of people without any comment.  One person called a member of the catering staff over and told them that they had had enough of their  lunch, having only eaten a quarter of the portion. They said, ""I'm still full from breakfast."" This was because  breakfast had not finished being served until 10am. We did not see people offered second helpings and the  only drink offered was orange squash after the meal. Three people were given shandy but this was not  offered to anyone else. Tea time was a similar experience with people not being offered a choice of drinks  and sat in the lounge for over 25 minutes before any food was offered. One person who needed assistance  with eating had been supported to the dining room before 4pm and left at a table. They did not did not  receive assistance until 4.40pm.  We saw in the kitchen a list of the planned meals for the first day of the inspection, along with people's  names, birthdays, type of diet and fluids, any allergies and dislikes and whether people liked to wear a  clothes protector during meals. Where people need support with eating this was noted in terms of  equipment needed such as plate guards or whether staff needed to assist. Staff were aware of who needed  extra support and how to report any concerns regarding a person's nutritional intake. However, food and  fluid charts only allowed staff to tick against a pre-completed amount such as ½, and did not indicate what  or how much food was actually offered. This is a breach of Regulation 9 Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 person-centred care as people's preferences and wishes were not  evidenced and the dining experience was very task-focused.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible.   Where people lacked capacity to agree to take their medication we did not see any capacity assessments or  best interest decisions. People did have decisions relating to 'understanding the necessity of 24 hour care'  but some of these were dated from 2014 and people's capacity had not been reassessed. We found some  evidence of consent discussions with people's appointed representatives where people were unable to   11 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  make the decisions themselves. However, these had not been regularly reviewed. Where people did have  capacity this was recorded and their written consent recorded.  Staff had a working knowledge of how mental capacity may affect someone and knew who was able to  make their own choices. One care worker explained, ""I always explain and ask them simple questions to  offer choice."" As the staff team was stable they knew people well and how their decisions may be  communicated such as pushing food away if they have had enough.  People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this is in their  best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care homes  and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was  working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person  of their liberty were being met.  Staff's understanding of DoLS was mixed as some told us they focused on making decisions in people's best  interests whereas others were aware of the restriction on people's liberty. The registered manager advised  there were six authorised DoLS in place with a further two applications awaiting decision. However, they  were unable to state who had conditions attached. We looked at the DoLS file and found very little evidence  of the necessary paperwork to ensure the service was meeting any DoLS conditions. One DoLS had been  granted in April 2017 but there was no corresponding paperwork and yet the previous DoLS had conditions  attached. The registered manager advised us they had not received this and yet we could see no evidence  this had been followed up with the supervisory body. This is a breach of Regulation 11 Health and Social  Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 need for consent as the registered manager was  unaware who had a current DoLS condition and therefore could not evidence they were compliant with  these.  We saw evidence health and social care services were requested for people. People had access to the GP,  district nurses, opticians and chiropodists when needed. Staff were able to explain effective pressure relief  care techniques. No one had a pressure sore and staff told us how they would report any concerns. We  spoke with a visiting health professional who told us, ""Staff are helpful. There are no problems at all. Staff  know people well and it's usually the same staff on duty."" They also said staff followed any advice given and  they were called to the home only when appropriate. One relative also confirmed, ""If needed, the GP is  called promptly.""  Some rooms were personalised with photographs. The lounges were not particularly welcoming as doors  were left open and the open alcoves meant noise carried between rooms. Some people in the lounge were  looking at a wall as chairs were lined up round the outside of the room and when the doors to the patio area were opened it meant the rooms lost their heat very quickly.  12 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   One person said, ""It's great. They look after me really well. I've been smoking since I was 16 and I'm 81.  Someone always wraps me up and stays with me when I go out for a quick one."" Another person told us,  ""They are kind, they look after me... If I want owt they get it for me, they're always popping by to check on me and have a chat."" One relative also told us, ""They are quite prompt at caring for you if you do need  anything."" Another relative spoke highly of how staff had made significant efforts to get to know their  relation. They stressed how staff had worked at the person's pace in terms of involvement in the home  rather than forcing events on the person.   People were able to receive visitors at any time. One person visiting the home told us, ""I visit [name] every  week and we sometimes take them out in their chair. Their relative comes sometimes as well, and we've  already got it planned; in a couple weeks we'll go down to the cenotaph cos it's Remembrance Sunday.""  Another relative said, ""Staff are always polite and friendly.""  It was one person's birthday on the second day of the inspection and they were brought a cake with candles  and everyone sang to them. There was a nice atmosphere of celebration. We found staff were caring, patient and kind when talking to people.  Staff demonstrated in-depth knowledge about people's wishes and lifestyle choices. They told us no one  had specific cultural or religious needs at present although there were visits from a local church every  couple of months for those who showed an interest. One care worker told us about people's different  interests including crochet, knitting and reading. The registered manager discussed the Equality Act in  regards to both staff and people living in the home, and said they focused on people as individuals, and  sought to meet their needs as best they could. The protected characteristics were embedded in the service's policies and procedures.  We observed staff routinely knocking and waiting to be invited into people's rooms before entering, and  then engaging in conversation once they had gone in. One person told us, ""They always knock on the door  before they come in."" One care worker said, ""We get close to them and whisper. Close doors and windows if  they can wash themselves. We let them do what they can for themselves.""  13 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We asked people if there was enough for them to do and one person said, ""I'm quite happy with what I get  here. I don't need a lot of support, but I go down for my meals, I have a lovely view from my room and I can  read and watch my TV. I'm not a fan of bingo, but the things I do like; I choose to join in with."" Another  person told us, ""There's not a lot of activities here, but I have my crochet and my knitting and stuff. It's all  piled up in this corner, so I keep myself busy.""  However, one visitor said, ""They could do with more in the way of activities for them."" We saw a flyer  advertising a coffee morning although it did not contain a time. One relative we spoke with was aware of it.  The TV was on in the first lounge on the first day but no one could hear it as the volume was too low. People  were not engaged with the programme. Records relating to activities were sparse; one person's file had the  last entry dated December 2016. There was a list of daily activities on the lounge door but the last date was 4 August 2017. One care worker did play with an inflatable ball with people but they were often called away to  deal with other issues.  The registered manager was aware of the limits of activities. They explained options had been discussed  with people, some of whom had requested trips and bingo. However, when such activities were arranged  they said people did not engage in them. The registered manager had recently undertaken some  reminiscence activity which people had engaged with.  We saw a newsletter advertising a forthcoming 'Glam 'n Glitz' evening and also celebrating people's  birthdays. One care worker discussed the party evening engaging with one person, ""Your [name] will like  that as they enjoy dancing.""  We looked at care records and found most were written in a person-centred manner. The registered  manager completed detailed pre-admission assessments to obtain information about people's needs. For  example, in one person's record it was recorded, ""[Name] hears when spoken to as they try to acknowledge  this by nodding or attempting to speak."" Where people were able to contribute their comments were noted  and written on the care plan. This included people's life histories which provided care staff with significant  information about previous occupation and interests to help them form relationships. Care plans included  information about people's mobility, nutritional needs, pressure care, communication needs, personal care  regime and medication support.  As with the risk assessments although care plans were reviewed on a monthly basis, this provided little value as the needs were not considered in full and information remained the same. One person's nutritional care  plan and risk assessment had been scored but this had not changed for over a year and yet their needs  presented quite differently from the care plan document. The care plan explicitly stated ""One member of  staff should sit at the side of [name] and inform them what the meal consisted of."" We did not observe this at any meal time with this person.  Daily notes recorded minimum detail about people's mood, activities and wellbeing and reflected task   14 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  based support only. We saw a 'bath book' which showed people only had showers on a weekly basis. This  was reflected in people's care plans where we saw it recorded, ""Requires help of two staff to maintain  weekly shower. Unable to help themselves wash or dress."" It was unclear whether a weekly shower was the  person's preference. This is a breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014 as records did not always reflect people's current need.  People we spoke with told us they would know what to do if there was an issue of concern. One person told  us, ""Look, I've no complaints about the staff, the cleanliness, the food or anything. I'm happy and settled  here."" Another person said, 'I'd go to the top, there's no point being worried about something and keeping it  to yourself.  If it was more minor, I'd just speak to one of the carers, they're all very good and helpful."" One  relative said, ""I'd go to the manager, or [name] is always around and very helpful."" Another relative who had  not had any cause to complain said, ""If there are any problems they sorted straight away.""  We were advised by the registered manager no complaints had been received as ""we get on well with  everyone."" However, we did find evidence of one which had been dealt with thoroughly. The provider's  complaints policy was displayed in the reception area along with a large number of thank you cards. One  visitor said, '""Look at all those cards; they're all thank you cards you know, so they must be doing something  right.""  15 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were happy in Hoyland Hall and knew the registered manager and names of the staff, speaking  positively of them. One relative said, ""I'm very happy my relation is here. I know they are settled and are well  looked after. This home cares about people."" Another relative stated on a recent survey, ""I have peace of  mind. They are well looked after.""  We found minutes of regular meetings with people who lived in the home. Discussions had included the  provision of meals, activities and upgrades to the bathrooms into wet rooms. We saw people and relatives  had completed a questionnaire asking a range of questions about the care at Hoyland Hall. Comments  included, ""I am very happy with the care and respect the staff have for my relative,"" ""warm, clean home,  lovely girls,"" and ""staff always nice and friendly to me. Help me shower. Give me good food."" One relative  told us, ""The manager's door is always open. They will talk about anything and are always very receptive.""  Staff spoke well of each other, stressing how they worked well as a team. One care worker said, ""There is a  handover morning and night between each senior who then tells us what we need to know."" Another care  worker said, ""The staff team are good. I come and try and do a good job. They will tell me if I have any  faults."" A further care worker told us, ""I'm very aware this is people's home and we try to offer the best  service we can.""  The registered manager was also spoken of highly of by staff. One care worker said, ""They are good. If they  are any problems they deal with them. The provider comes in most days. If we need anything we just tell  them and then they get it."" Another care worker said, ""Yes, I feel listened to."" The registered manager  endorsed this view saying, ""The director visits daily and there are never any cutbacks. Nothing is frozen or  pre-packed, everything is prepared fresh."" We saw evidence of regular provider visits which referenced  conversations with people in the home and a walk-around the premises to identify any concerns. They also  looked at supervision and training records to ensure these were up to date.  The registered manager explained staff meetings were not always recorded as they caught staff ""10 minutes  here and there"" and as they were a small staff team this seemed to work. We saw minutes of staff meetings  which had discussed care plan recordings, amendments to DoLS legislation, training updates and how to  engage better with people in the home while acknowledging the time constraints on staff to do this.  We asked how the quality of service provision was reviewed and the registered manager advised, ""Through  questionnaires which people and visitors complete, and also when we speak to families."" Some of the  comments from visitors and health professionals included, ""Staff are great, friendly and helpful,"" ""This is a  really nice care home,"" and ""All staff are accommodating, welcoming and aware of people's needs."" Some  suggestions for improvements were made such as ensuring people were offered a choice of where to sit and  activity boards to be on display. One care worker when asked how they knew they were doing a good job  told us, ""By my appraisal and I would be told if I needed to improve anything.""   There were no other formal auditing tools in use which meant the registered manager was unable to   16 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  evidence how they knew their care delivery was safe and effective.   The registered manager was keen to state people did not have keyworkers as they felt this meant people  became reliant on specific staff and this was to their detriment. Instead, all care workers were responsible  for reviewing three care plans every month to ensure they were up to date, and these were then audited by  the registered manager. We did not see evidence of any auditing paperwork which meant the quality of  these evaluations had not been addressed. This is a breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 as there were no systems in place to assess, monitor and improve  the quality of service provision.  We asked the registered manager what their vision for the home was and they said, ""To get everything  sorted and finished"" in relation to the premises' improvements. In regards to care they stressed they wanted  people to be 'safe and comfortable in their latter years and to have good relationships with all services they  came into contact with."" They felt their key achievements were, ""a good relationship between staff and  outside agencies."" They felt all staff were very friendly and were hospitable with any visitors.  Hoyland Hall had its rating and report on display on the reception area of the home.  17 Hoyland Hall Residential Home Inspection report 21 March 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

A registered manager was in post. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality  Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered  persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and  associated Regulations about how the service is run.  Maryland is a care home which provides personal care for up to a maximum of 30 people. The care home is  situated in the centre of Formby with easy access to public transport and shops. The home has three  lounges, a dining room and conservatory. There is limited car parking and the front door entrance provides  disabled access.  Risk assessments were in place, however, some lacked specific guidance and personalisation with regards  to specific risks for people.   Some information concerning records relating to the health and safety of people living at the home were not always robust enough. Some information about falls, was available, however, the analysis of falls was not in  depth enough to help prevent future occurrences. For example we saw that despite the provider taking  action in response to a recent incident, they had not thoroughly documented this. This meant was there was no evidence to show what actions were taken. Also, some records such as weight, food and fluid charts were difficult to find because they were not always kept organised. Audits were in place and took into account the environment, care planning, medication and any incidents in general; however, these audits were not  always robust enough as they did not identify remedial action needed.    Medication storage and stock checking was not always in line with guidelines. The temperature of the room  where medication was stored had not been recorded. Dates were not recorded on open bottles of  medication to show when they were first opened, and protocols where not in place for the use of as and  when required (PRN) medications. Stock balances of medication were difficult to count as totals had not  been carried forward. We have made a recommendation about the management of medicines.  The registered manager and the staff had knowledge of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) and their roles and  responsibilities linked to this. People's consent was recorded for most areas of care. We did highlight the  wording of the mental capacity assessments the registered manager was using as they did not always make  it clear which decision was being taken into consideration. We have made a recommendation regarding  this.  People could not always remember whether or not they had been involved in the development of their care  plans. Some care plans were signed by people where they had the capacity to do so; however care plans for  some people showed no evidence of the person's involvement. Care plans contained some information   2 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  about people's preferences and wishes for support. Information was recorded with regards to people's  backgrounds, hobbies and interests. Some of the information required further expanding to be more person  centred and to show people's involvement and how their choices influence their care.   People  told us they felt safe living at the home and we received positive comments in relation to this.  People also told us there was enough staff on duty at the home and there did appear to be enough staff.   There was a safe process in place for the recruitment and selection of staff. Staff were only offered positions  once a DBS check had taken place and references were obtained.   Staff described the process they would follow if they felt someone was being harmed in any way, this  included reporting their concerns to their line manager in the first instance, and  reporting to external  organisations.   Infection control procedures were evident in the home, and the provider had recently updated some of their  policies in relation to this.   All of the staff had completed mandatory training in line with the providers training policy which was a mix  of e-learning and face to face courses. Medication training was completed separately and consisted of  longer face to face training sessions and annual competencies.   People had access to health care as and when they needed it. Records detailing visits with healthcare  professionals were kept in people's care files.   People told us they liked the food. The chef was aware of people's individual dietary needs and preferences.   People told us they liked the staff, and we received positive comments concerning how staff treated people.   Complaints were managed well, and the registered manager kept a log on all complaints and any remedial  action taken as a result.   There was provider oversight at the home, as the provider was there most days and was heavily involved in  the running of the home. On day one of our inspection, the provider and registered manager were on leave.  The deputy manager supported this inspection; however they were unable to provide us with some  information which we asked for because they were unsure where some things were kept. We discussed this  with the registered manager and provider at the time of our inspection.   People spoke positively about the registered manager and the provider and said they were very visible  within the home.   Team meetings took place, however they were not always regular. The last team meeting took place in  September 2016, and there had not been one since.   The rating from the last inspection was displayed in the home.   3 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not always safe.   Risks assessments did not always contain enough information to help guide staff about keeping people safe.  Medication storage and documentation was not in line with best  practice guidelines.  We have made a recommendation about  this.   People said they felt safe living at the home.     Infection control procedures were in place in at the home and  these had been recently reviewed. We shared some additional  information from our observations with the provider.   	  The service was not always effective.   Staff sought the consent of people before providing care and  support. The home followed the principles of the Mental  Capacity Act (2005) for people who lacked mental capacity to  make their own decisions however this was not always clear. We  have made a recommendation regarding this.   Staff were regularly supervised and had an annual appraisal.  Staff were appropriately inducted into their roles.   Staff training was in date and they received regular refreshers in  line with the providers training policy.   	  The service was caring.   We observed kind, friendly and familiar interactions between   4 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Good    Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    staff and people who lived at the home.  Staff preserved people's dignity and respect whilst supporting  them, people gave us examples of this.   Advocacy services were displayed for people who may wish to  make use of this facility.    	  The service was not always responsive.   People's information was not well organised. It was difficult to  find some people's information within their care plans.   Information about people's backgrounds, likes and dislikes was  recorded at some level in their care plans.  Complaints were well managed and responded to in accordance  with the providers complaints policy. People said they knew how  to complain.   	  The service was not always well-led.   There were audits (checks) taking place on service provision such as health and safety checks. Some audits, such as medication  audits and care plans audits were not robust enough.    People spoke positively about the provider and the registered  manager and said they were approachable.   Documented records such as team meetings and resident  meetings did not occur often. However, took place more  informally.   The ratings were displayed from the last CQC inspection. The  registered manager was open and transparent and  acknowledged the need to improve in some areas.   5 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017     Maryland Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  The inspection took place on 18 & 24 July 2017 and was unannounced. At the time of our inspection there  were 28 people living at the home.   The inspection team consisted of an adult social care inspector and an expert by experience. An expert by  experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of  care service. In this instance, the expert had expertise in care of older people.   Before our inspection we reviewed the information we held about the home. This included the Provider  Information Return (PIR). A PIR is a form that asks the provider to give some key information about the  service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to make. This included  information the  Care Quality Commission had received about the home. We had not requested a PIR from the provider, We  had received concerns from the local authority with regards to risk assessments, records and provider  oversight of the home. We checked these concerns as part of this inspection.   During the inspection we spoke with eight people who were living at the home and they shared their views  of the home with us. We also sought feedback from three relatives who were visiting the home at the time of  our inspection. We spoke with six staff, including the registered manager, the chef and the provider.    We looked at the care records for three people living at the home, two staff personnel files and records  relevant to the quality monitoring of the service. We looked around the home, including people's bedrooms, the kitchen, bathrooms, garden and the lounge areas.  6 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017   	  Requires Improvement  	"   Prior to our inspection we had received concerns that risks, particularly in relation to falls, were not always  managed effectively. We checked this as part of this inspection. We saw that most risk assessments were in  place for people who required them; however the risk assessments did not always contain enough  information to help keep people safe.   For example, one person's care plan described them as being at risk of blackouts. We saw that this was  something the person regularly experienced. The person's care plan recorded that if the person 'feels dizzy   staff are to point a medical device at the person's heart and take a reading'. There was no further  explanation, and there was no accompanying risk assessment which explained what the device was, how  staff were to use it, and what the readings meant for the person. Also, there was no remedial action for staff  to follow depending on the reading.    Another person was at risk of weight loss and was assessed as needing as special diet and  required  'prompting' to eat. We saw in the back of the person's care plan there was information around what the  person's diet should be, and the chef was able to demonstrate they had knowledge of this. However, there  was no risk assessment in place around the person's risk of weight loss and what remedial action staff  should take to encourage the person to eat, and what level of staff support the person required.   We saw that one person's falls risk assessment was not completed accurately. Some of the information  contained in the rest of the person's care plan and in their pre- assessment information did not marry up  with the falls assessment. For example, the person had a hearing impairment, and wore two hearing aids;  however the falls risk assessment stated that their hearing was fine.   The falls risk assessments for people also did not capture if they had a history of falls which would help to  assess if they were high risk. There was an incident and accident analysis in place which the provider had   completed each month in relation to incidents and accidents which had occurred at the home. Falls were  included in this; however, the actual falls analysis lacked sufficient detail to help mitigate future risk. For  example, what remedial action had been put into place since the person had fallen, and any referrals which  had been made. This meant that any emerging patterns or trends  might not be identified, therefore  appropriate action might not always be taken.   This is a breach of regulation 12 (2) (a) (b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Risks to people's health and safety were not always assessed and  mitigated.   We did see however, that people were being referred to both the falls clinic and the Occupational Therapist  (OT) for reassessment following a fall. One person had their mobility equipment changed because of this  from the OT. This information was not documented, however, on the falls analysis as an action that had  been taken.   We looked at the procedure in place for medications. We saw that medication was stored in two locked   7 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  trolleys, in a locked room. We saw that the temperature of the room was not being recorded. This is  important, because if the medication is stored with the exceeded temperature range it could affect its ability to work. We highlighted this at the time to the deputy manager, and they said they would put this in place.  On day two of our inspection we saw this was in place.   There was a procedure in place to store, record and administer controlled drugs (CDs). Controlled drugs are  medications with additional safeguards placed on them under the misuse of drugs act.   We counted the stock balance for three people's loose medications. We found that stock balances were  right, however, it took us some considerable time to work out these balances due to the fact that numbers  of medication carried forward were not documented on the medication administration record (MAR). We  looked back at previous MARs and saw these totals had been carried forward. We highlighted this at the  time, and were told that the provider usually does the medication check, and as they had been away on  holiday this might not have been done this time.   We found some liquid medications were opened, however the date they had been opened was not written  on the label. This meant there was a risk that the medication had exceeded its use by date. The medications  we looked at had only recently been dispensed from the pharmacy, so they were safe to use. We checked  the eye drops for one person, and saw that they were all within their use by date, and being stored correctly.   We saw one person's medication contained eardrops which had been prescribed in November 2016. The  pharmacy label directed that the eardrops were to be discarded after six months of opening. We asked the  deputy manager to action this straight away. The eardrops had been discontinued some months previous,  so the person was not at risk, as the staff were not administering them, however, the stock had not been  returned to pharmacy and the records were not updated to reflect this.    People were prescribed pain relief such as paracetamol to be given as and when required (PRN). We saw on  the first day of our inspection there were no plans in place for people about the use of PRN medication. This  meant that staff might not be aware of when to offer PRN, what the PRN medication is for, and how the  person asks for it if they are able too. We saw on the second day of our inspection that plans for the use of  PRN medication were being put into place for people. We recommend that the provider seeks current  guidance on medication procedures and take action to update their practice accordingly.   All people living at the home said that they felt safe. Comments included, ""I feel comfortable"" ""Always feel  safe"". ""Yes, they're very precise with that they have CCTV.  They're very keen on visitors signing in"".   All people, except one, told us there was enough staff on shift to be able to meet their needs. Comments  included, ""Plenty of staff – tripping over them at times"". ""Plenty of staff"".  One person however told us they  felt there was not enough staff, but also added that they did not feel this impacted on the care they received. All of the staff we spoke with said there were enough of them to deliver safe care and that they never felt  rushed or pressured. Our observation around the home on the two days of our inspection found there was  enough staff to keep people safe. We did however raise that the deployment of staff rather than the numbers may need to be looked at, as there were times throughout the day when communal rooms people occupied  were left unattended, but not for long periods.   The registered manager retained comprehensive records relating to each staff member. Full pre- employment checks were carried out prior to a member of staff commencing work. This included keeping a  record of the interview process for each member of staff and ensuring two references were obtained and  kept on file.   8 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  The registered manager also requested a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) certificate for each member  of staff prior to them commencing work. A valid check is a requirement for all staff employed to care and  support people within health and social care settings. This enabled the registered manager to assess the  applicant's suitability for working with vulnerable adults prior to an offer of employment.  We saw that all firefighting equipment had been checked, and new equipment was in place in various parts  of the home to help people evacuate safely. Personal emergency evacuation plans (PEEP's) explained each  person's level of dependency and what support they would require to ensure they were evacuated safely.  We spot checked some of the other certificates for portable appliance testing (PAT), electric, gas, and  legionella. These were all in date.   We checked the process for preventing the spread of infection in the home. The home had recently been  audited by the local authority's infection control team and had been assigned some actions. We saw they  had met all of the actions on their action plan. We saw there was personal protective equipment (PPE) in  place for staff to use. We did raise with the provider on day two of our inspection that staff were not wearing  aprons when serving people food on day 1 of our inspection. We felt this was important because staff did  not wear uniforms and were also completing laundry for people. This could increase the risk of cross  contamination. On day two of our inspection, we saw that the staff wore disposable aprons whilst serving  people their lunch.   9 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We sat and dinned with people during lunchtime. The meal tasted good and was nicely presented. There  were 21 people seated in the room with the chef serving from a hatch to four staff who served and attended  to people. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxed.  The staff worked together well and were efficient in their  work. They interacted well with people and encouraged people to eat.    There was orange juice and tea available at the start of the meal and tea again at the end of the meal. All  people were asked if they wanted a drink and for their choice of main course. We observed people were not  rushed at the end of the meal. They were asked where they would like to go after the meal if they needed  escorting/support. We asked people what they thought of the food and we received the following  comments, ""Very good food and plenty of it.  ""Choice of meals.  Plenty of tea and coffee"". ""Nice meals"". ""The  cooks are very good"". ""Enough to eat and drink, we get a choice of meals – pretty good quality, some things  are better than others.""  ""Fine, lovely – as much as you want, drinks whenever you want"". ""Food is very good,  I get a cup of tea in my bedroom at 7am"".  The provider had invested recently in the home. All of the bedrooms had en-suite facilities, and there was an additional section added to the home for the sole purpose of more space. There were quiet lounges people  could spend time in if they wished as well as a large conservatory and garden area.   People were supported to access medical care when they needed it. Each person's care plan contained a  log of professional's visits. These were completed by staff following each appointment people attended,  including the reason for the appointment and the outcome.    The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are  called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). The DoLS provide a legal framework to protect people  who need to be deprived of their liberty in their own best interests.  We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. We saw that applications had been  submitted to the local authority to deprive people of their liberty in their best interests and these were being  monitored by the registered manager and further applications had been made when needed.   We spent time with the deputy manager on the first day of our inspection discussing the MCA, and the  registered manager and provider on the second day of our inspection. It was evident that there was a good   10 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  amount of knowledge in relation to the MCA. Staff had received training around the MCA, as they were able  to explain the key principles of the act. However, there was some inconsistent information in people's care  plans relating to decisions and what they could decide for themselves which needed to be further explained.  For example, we saw that a mental capacity assessment for one person stated that the person 'did not have  capacity.' However it did not state what decisions the person was unable to make. We saw from looking at  the person's care plan that they were able to 'follow instructions' from staff verbally; which would suggest  this person could make some choices for themselves. There was also a section in the person's care plan,  which stated things that they could do, and what they needed help with. We raised with the provider that  the MCA assessments implied that the person could not make any decisions, which was confusing and  contradictory. We checked some other people's mental capacity assessments against their care plans and  saw that the wording was the same, which meant that the registered manager had not took into account  people's individual decision making abilities. We recommend that the provider refers to the relevant  legislation around the MCA and takes action to update their practice accordingly.     We saw that consent was documented in people's care plans and we heard staff asking people for their  consent for different things during the course of our inspection.   The provider emailed us a copy of their training matrix after the inspection had taken place. We saw that all  staff had received regular training in accordance with the providers training policy. Training was a mixture of face to face training and e-learning. All of the staff we spoke with said they had completed training, and had  attended refreshers to update their knowledge, understanding and skills. We saw certificates in staff files  which confirmed the training had taken place on the specified days. There was additional more in depth  training rolled out to staff who administered medications. This involved shadow opportunities and  competency checks for the staff member to ensure they had the correct skills and were completing this  correctly.   Staff had an induction which was aligned to the principles of The Care Certificate. Once the modules of this  were completed a senior staff member signed off the induction as being complete. The Care Certificate is  the governments 'blue print' to assist staff who are new to health and social care to become more  knowledgeable at their roles. This is split up into modules and is usually completed within the first 12 weeks  of employment.   Staff received a one to one supervision every 12 weeks, and all staff told us that the registered manager had  an open door policy where they were able to request a supervision if they needed one. Appraisals took place annually.   11 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Good  	"   We received mostly positive comments in relation to the caring nature of the staff. Comments included,  ""Very well treated"". ""Overall very, very happy"". ""Staff are very good"". ""Very good staff - kind and caring"". ""Well  looked after – very pleased"". ""Staff treat me in a friendly way.  Always kind and cheerful"". We spoke to a  visitor who said, ""Fantastic, staff know them all really well."" Also, ""Not seen any staff with a bad attitude"".  People told us that staff respected their privacy, dignity and choice and were able to give us examples of  this. One person said, ""They never interfere with my business.  Always knock on my door"" ""If you wanted  them to give you a shower they would but I do it myself"". ""They treat me with dignity and respect –  especially in the bath"". We asked staff to describe how they ensured they treated people well, and what  types of things they thought were important. One member of staff said, ""I always asked their permission  before I do things."" Another member of staff said, ""Never just barge into their room, this is their home.""   We observed staff talking to people with kindness and familiarity throughout the duration of our inspection.  Staff spoke quietly to people in communal areas so others did not over hear, and asked people if they  wanted support with anything.   One person did say that they felt forgotten about as they spent a lot of time on their own. We raised this with the registered managed on day two of our inspection and they assured us both through documented  information and verbally this was through the person's own choice.   We saw that most people had signed their care plans to say they had been involved in the completion and  the reviewing of them, however some people told us they could not remember seeing their care plan, but  they might have forgotten about it.   We saw that there was advocacy information displayed around the home. There was no one making use of  advocacy services at the time of our inspection.   People's confidential information was stored securely in a lockable cabinet. There was no confidential  information on display around the home.   12 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We spent time looking through people's care plans. We saw that some information was in place to help keep people safe, and this was being updated every month. There was however, some confusing information in  people's care files which led to some parts of the care plans appearing disorganised.  For example, there  was a contents sheet on the front of each person's care file; however the information was not where it was  supposed to be. In one person's care file we found some hand written blood pressure readings which had  been taken by staff in response to advice from the persons GP. There was however, no further record to say  why this was needed or when the staff should record the person's blood pressure. The readings were  recorded in another section in the person's care plan and no one knew why the hand written readings had  been left in the care file. People had information in their care plans they needed, such as weight charts, food  and fluid balance charts, and skin care plans, however they were not always easy to find due to the setup of  the care plans. This meant it was difficult to find some information for people as the care plans did not  follow a specific order.   This was a Breach of Regulation 17 (2) (c) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Records about people were not always accurately maintained and kept up to date.   We discussed this with the registered manager on day two of our inspection, and they acknowledged that  the care plans did require re-formatting so information was easy to find and followed an organised order.   There was personalised information in people's care plans. For example, we saw that one person liked  books and not newspapers, and it was important to them that their glasses were clean. Some of the  information was basic, stating what time the person goes to bed and gets up. Some care plans stated choice of staff gender, others did not always state this. Most people had some background information about their  past, family and hobbies recorded in their care plans.   We received mostly positive comments when we asked people about opportunities available at the home to keep them occupied throughout the day. Some visitors felt there could be more going on.  Comments  included, ""Not much for people,"" And it would be nice if there was more for them to do."" However most  people spoke positively about this, comments included, ""They have concerts – haven't been yet but been  asked to go"". ""Go out in garden, go to church"". ""Occasionally a group will come and play music and a  keyboard man twice a week, yoga once a week"". ""Gardens are nice"". ""I sew and do word searches"". ""One of  the clergy came this morning – that was very nice"". ""They have poetry readings, band came in a few weeks  ago, get a newspaper every day, hairdresser comes"". Also ""I think it's beautiful and perfect – sit in lounge or  in garden or whatever"". ""Go out for walks and do a bit of pottering in the garden"".  There was an events table in place with regards to activities. On day one of our inspection people were  taking part in chair yoga. Most of the activities were arranged from external organisations. The provider did  not employ an activities coordinator, the staff arranged and facilitated activities for people between  themselves.   13 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  People we spoke with told us they knew how to complain. Comments included, ""Yes, would talk to staff"". ""If I had a complaint I'd soon tell them"". ""No complaints at all, very nice"". We saw a copy of the provider's   complaints procedure  displayed in the main hallway of the home, as well as in the Service User Guide. We  looked at records of a complaint made to ensure the manager had followed the process, we saw that they  had.  14 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We checked the auditing systems in place at the home. We saw there were audits in place for the  environment and health and safety where systems had been appropriately checked and action plans  formulated.  We saw however, despite there being some form of auditing in place with regards to care plans  and medication, these audits were not robust enough to identify some of the concerns we found during our  inspection. Some of the information contained in these audits, for example, the falls audit, was not thorough enough, and did not provide sufficient detail into the responsiveness of the staff, and action taken to  prevent further falls. Additionally, the organisation of records and wording of documentation was not picked up on in an audit.  Also, the medication audits did not identify the issues we raised with regards to  medication. This meant that auditing systems were not always effective.   This is a breach of regulation 17 (2) (c) (f) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014.  Systems in place for assessing, monitoring and improving the service were not always  effective.    Provider oversight was sometimes difficult, as one of the providers was also the registered manager and the  owner of the home. In addition, they worked at the home delivering support, so it was not always easy for  them to see the gaps in service provision.  The provider did acknowledge these shortfalls during our  discussions with them on the second day of inspection. In some ways, the provider was so hands on, it was  evident that not all staff knew were things were kept or were able to find some information, this was  apparent on the first day of our inspection because staff were unable to find some documentation which we  asked for.    There was a registered manager in post who was also one of the owners of the home. They had been in post  for a long time.   Everyone we spoke with said they liked the registered manager and the provider. Comments included, ""Yes,  they're approachable – very nice"". ""Can talk to registered manager - we get on alright"". ""Can talk to them  whenever I want"". ""Yes, very approachable"". ""Registered manager comes to see me to ask me how I am"". All  of the staff we spoke with said that the registered manger was hands on and supportive. One staff member  said, ""You can always approach them, they are really nice.""   All of the staff said they would recommend the home to other potential employers, and commented and on  the homely feel. Additionally, people who lived at the home commented, """"Very good"". ""Nice and peaceful"".   The provider had policies and guidance for staff regarding safeguarding, whistle blowing, dignity,  independence, respect, equality and safety. Staff were aware of these policies and their roles and  responsibilities within them. This ensured there were clear processes for staff to account for their decisions,  actions, behaviours and performance.    We saw that the Care Quality Commission had been notified appropriately of incidents and events which   15 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  occur at the service, as legally required by law.   The provider had developed good systems for getting feedback from people living at the home and their  relatives. We saw that feedback was regularly acted upon, for example, people had raised they no longer  wanted bananas, so these were taken off the menu.   Team meetings and resident meetings took place every year and we were able to view minutes of these. The last meetings took place in September 2016. We raised with the registered manager, as the gap in between  meetings was quite large. The registered manager explained that feedback is mostly gathered informally,  due to the provider and registered manager being at the home every day, they always chat to people.   From April 2015 it became a legal requirement for providers to display their CQC (Care Quality Commission)  rating. 'The ratings are designed to improve transparency by providing people who use services, and the  public, with a clear statement about the quality and safety of care provided'. The ratings tell the public  whether a service is outstanding, good, requires improvement or inadequate. The rating from the previous  inspection for Maryland was displayed for people to see.  16 Maryland Care Home Inspection report 13 September 2017  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

The inspection was unannounced on  the first day and announced on the second day. We previously inspected the service on 20 July 2016 and at  that time we found the provider was not meeting the regulations relating to safe care and treatment,  premises and equipment, and good governance. On this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made, however we found one new breach of the regulations.  The Lodge is a 'care home'. People in care homes receive accommodation and nursing or personal care as a single package under one contractual agreement. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) regulates both the  premises and the care provided, and both were looked at during this inspection.  The Lodge provides a service for up to seven adults who have a learning disability and behaviour that may  challenge others. The home provides accommodation and support over two floors; one floor for three men  and the other for four women. Bathroom and toilet facilities on each floor are shared. The home is close to  community facilities including, shops, cafes, a bank, post office and garden centre.   There was a registered manager in post who had been registered since January 2016. A registered manager  is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered  providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the  requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is  run.  Staff had a good understanding of how to safeguard adults from abuse and who to contact if they suspected any abuse.  Risks assessments were individual to people's needs and minimised risk whilst promoting people's  independence. Detailed individual behaviour support plans gave staff the direction they needed to provide  safe care.  Building maintenance and hygiene had improved and some areas of the home had been refurbished.  Safe recruitment and selection processes were in place. We reviewed the systems for the management of  medicines and found that people received their medicines safely.   Sufficient staff were deployed to provide a good level of interaction. The required number of staff was  provided to meet people's assessed needs, although one person, whose support needs had changed, was  unable to access the community on occasion while they were awaiting a re-assessment of their support  needs.  Staff told us they felt supported, however we found they were not always supported with regular   2 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  management supervision. Staff had received an induction and role specific training, which ensured they had the knowledge and skills to support the people who lived at the home.  People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported them in the  least restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service supported this practice, although some  best interest processes had not been evidenced.   People were supported to eat a balanced diet, and meals were planned around their tastes and preferences.  People were supported to maintain good health and had access to healthcare professionals and services.  They were supported and encouraged to have regular health checks and were accompanied by staff to  health appointments.   Positive relationships between staff and people who lived at The Lodge were evident. Staff were caring and  supported people in a way that maintained their dignity, privacy and diverse needs.  People were involved in arranging their support and staff facilitated this on a daily basis. People were  supported to be as independent as possible throughout their daily lives.  Care records contained detailed information on how to support people and included measures to protect  them from social isolation. People engaged in social activities which were person-centred.  Systems were in place to ensure complaints were encouraged, explored and responded to in good time and  people told us staff were always approachable.  People told us the service was well-led. The registered manager was visible in the service and knew people's  needs.  Records at the home could not evidence regular staff supervision was in place. This was the only breach of  regulation identified at this inspection, and showed that whilst much improvement had been made since  the last inspection, some concerns relating to governance remained.  Improvements had been made to oversight and audit within the service, although there were some recent  gaps.  The registered provider's system of oversight had not identified and addressed the problem we found with  staff supervision. Management input at the service had been reduced to three days a week in July 2017,  which appeared to have impacted on the sustainability of recent improvements in governance.   Feedback from staff was positive about the registered manager and they told us they felt supported. People  who used the service and their representatives were asked for their views about the service and they were  acted on.  We found one breach of the health and social Care Act (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. You can see  what action we told the provider to take at the back of the full version of the report.  3 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Good    Requires Improvement    Good    	  The service was safe.  Risk assessments were individual to people's needs and  minimised risk whilst promoting people's independence.  The building was maintained and managed in a safe way and  emergency plans were in place.  Medicines were managed in a safe way for people.  Staff had a good understanding of safeguarding people from  abuse.   	  The service was not always effective.  Staff did not always receive supervision and appraisal to support  their professional development needs.  Staff had received specialist training to enable them to provide  support to the people who lived at The Lodge.  People's consent to care and treatment was always sought;  however, some best interest decision-making had not been  recorded.  People were supported to eat and drink enough and maintain a  balanced diet. Healthy eating was promoted.  	  The service was caring.   Staff interacted with people in a caring and respectful way.  People were supported in a way that protected their privacy,  dignity and diverse needs.  People were supported to be as independent as possible in their  daily lives.  4 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  Good    Requires Improvement    	  The service was responsive.  People's care plans were person-centred and individualised.  People were supported to participate in activities both inside  and outside the service.  People told us they knew how to complain and that staff were  always approachable.  	  The service was not always well-led.  The service had improved since the last inspection, however a  new breach of regulation showed some issues with governance  remained.  The registered provider had an overview of the service, although  this system had not identified and addressed the issues we  found.  The culture was positive, person-centred, open and inclusive.  The registered manager was visible in the service and knew the  needs of people.  The registered manager used good practice and partnership  working in addition to audit to drive improvement at the home.  5 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017     The Lodge  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 11 and 18 October 2017 and was unannounced on the first day and  announced on the second day. The membership of the inspection team consisted of one adult social care  inspector and an expert-by-experience. An expert-by-experience is a person who has personal experience of  using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The area of expertise for the expert by  experience on this inspection was learning disabilities.  Prior to our inspection we reviewed all the information we held about the service. This included information  from notifications received from the registered provider, and feedback from the local authority safeguarding and commissioning teams. After the inspection we received feedback from two community health  professionals. The registered provider was asked to complete a Provider Information Return, however this  was not completed. This is a form that asks the provider to give some key information about the service,  what the service does well and improvements they plan to make.  We used a number of different methods to help us understand the experiences of people who used the  service. Some people communicated non-verbally and as we were not familiar with everyone's way of  communicating we used observation as a means of understanding their experience. We spent time in the  lounge areas and dining rooms observing the care and support people received. We looked in the bedrooms of four people who used the service. We spoke with five people and three relatives on the telephone. We  spoke with the registered manager, two senior support workers and two support workers. We looked at four  care records, four staff files, accident and incident records, medicines administration systems, maintenance  records and quality monitoring systems  6 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   	  Good  	"   People told us they felt safe at The lodge. One person said, ""I feel safe here and there are enough staff to  help me when I need them.""   Relatives we spoke with said, ""Yes, I feel my [relative] is safe at The Lodge. [My relative] seems a lot happier  when [they] come home nowadays, so that tells me that [my relative] is settling well there."" Another relative  said, ""I certainly do feel that my [relative] is safe there. I am not too sure about the staffing levels at the  moment as some have recently left due to the renovations. I think there are more agency staff on as a result  of this so I will reserve judgment on that question for the time being."" A third relative said, ""I feel my [relative] has changed so much for the better since being at The Lodge. [My relative] looks so much better in  [themselves] and is very happy with the staff and very happy with [their] housemates. We certainly think [my  relative] is safe living there.""  At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to safe care and treatment because some risks had not been identified so they could be reduced and  managed safely. We also found behavioural incidents were not always recorded and reviewed in order to  reduce incidents and keep people safe from harm. At this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made.  Systems were in place to manage and reduce risks to people. In people's care records we saw  comprehensive risk assessments to mitigate risks in relation to behaviour that may challenge others, self- harm, falls, choking, physical health, financial capability, decision making, refusal of medication, hot  weather, and transport. Risk assessments were detailed and contained clear directions for staff to ensure  risk was managed well. We saw these assessments were reviewed regularly and up to date. The members of  staff we spoke with understood people's individual abilities and how to ensure risks were minimised whilst  promoting people's independence. This showed the service had a risk management system in place which  ensured risks were managed without impinging on people's rights and freedoms.  Care plans and incident records showed physical intervention was only used as a last resort to prevent harm to the person concerned or to those close by. All such incidents were clearly documented and records  showed each incident was subject to senior staff review with any lessons learned translated into care plans.  Staff we spoke with were able to describe de-escalation techniques and how they minimised the use of  restraint.  Staff told us they recorded and reported all incidents and people's individual care records were updated as  necessary. We saw in the incident and accident log that incidents and accidents had been recorded and an  incident report had been completed for each one. Staff were aware of any escalating concerns and took  appropriate action. We saw the registered provider had a system in place for analysing accidents and  incidents to look for themes. This demonstrated they were keeping an overview of the safety in the home.  At our last inspection we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulations related to premises   7 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  and equipment because some of the systems in place to ensure maintenance and cleaning tasks were  completed were not effective. At this inspection we checked and found improvements had been made.  At the time of this inspection the home was being refurbished and improvements had been made to the  carpets, bathrooms, one kitchen and décor at the home. One extra bedroom had been completed on the  upper floor and a small office was awaiting decorating, which meant many records were being held next  door at a different home managed by the same provider.  The service was generally clean and odour-free, with some crumbs and debris on the upper floor prior to the cleaner completing their tasks there. The service employed a cleaner for communal areas and night staff  also completed cleaning tasks. We found cleaning schedules were now being followed, although the kitchen floor on the upper floor was sticky prior to the cleaner commencing. People were supported to clean their  own flats or rooms and there was a good supply of personal protective equipment to prevent the spread of  infections. Hand soap was not immediately available to staff throughout the home due to wall mounted  dispensers awaiting replacement. We raised this with the registered manager and she addressed this  immediately.  At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to safe care and treatment because people did not have personal evacuation plans (PEEP) in place. PEEPs  are a record of how each person should be supported if the building needs to be evacuated. At this  inspection we checked and found improvements had been made and people had a PEEP in place. Regular  fire drills were completed and people and staff were aware of the procedure to follow. This showed us the  home had plans in place in the event of an emergency situation.  We reviewed staffing levels at the service. At our last inspection on each night shift there was one waking  night staff member and one sleep in staff member. We found the member of staff on sleeping night duty was frequently woken due to the needs of people using the service. This meant they were more likely to be  working whilst tired and at risk of making mistakes. At this inspection we found improvements had been  made and the registered provider had changed the night staff rota so two waking night staff were on duty.  Most people and three out of four staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on duty. One staff  member felt more staff would enable them to take a person out whose behavioural needs had changed. The registered manager told us each person who used the service was allocated staff according to their assessed needs and we saw this was reflected in their care records and tallied with the number of staff on duty. We  observed there were appropriate staffing levels on the days of our inspection which meant people received  sufficient support, although one person was unable to go out as they were awaiting a reassessment of their  increased support needs in the community.  The registered manager told us she was currently recruiting for three new care staff members as some staff  had been moved to another service. The provider had their own bank of staff to cover for absence and asked regular bank staff to do extra shifts in the event of sickness, as well as using occasional agency staff. This  meant people were normally supported and cared for by staff who knew them well.  We reviewed the system used to support people with their medicines. Blister packs were used for most  medicines at the home, with some dispensed in bottles and boxes. We found all of the medicines we  checked could be accurately reconciled with the amounts recorded as received and administered. We saw a  stock check was completed three times a day and signed by two members of staff. Senior staff completed  weekly and monthly audits. This demonstrated the home had good medicines governance.  8 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  People's medicines, including topical creams, were stored safely in a locked cupboard in each person's  room or in the medicines room on the lower floor. Body maps were in place to guide staff where to  administer topical creams in the medicines records we sampled.   Staff we spoke with had a good understanding of the medicines they were administering and we saw  medicines being administered as prescribed. Medicines care plans contained detailed information about  medicines and how the person liked to take them, including care plans for medicines prescribed 'when  required', such as pain-killers. Having a 'when required' care plan in place provides guidelines for staff to  ensure these medicines are administered in a safe and consistent manner. This meant people were  protected against the risks associated with medicines because the provider had appropriate arrangements  in place to manage medicines.  The registered manager told us all staff at the home completed training in safe administration of medicines  every year and we saw certificates to confirm this. We saw staff competence in giving medicines was also  assessed regularly. This meant people received their medicines from staff who had the appropriate  knowledge and skills.  All the staff we spoke with demonstrated they understood how to ensure people were safeguarded against  abuse and they knew the procedure to follow to report any incidents. We saw safeguarding incidents had  been dealt with appropriately when they arose and safeguarding authorities and CQC had been notified.  This showed the registered manager was aware of her responsibilities in relation to safeguarding people at  The Lodge.  Staff knew the whistleblowing procedure and said they would be confident to report any bad practice in  order to ensure people's rights were protected. We saw information around the building about reporting  abuse and whistleblowing.  We saw from staff files recruitment was robust and all vetting had been carried out prior to staff working  with people. For example, the registered manager ensured references had been obtained and Disclosure  and Barring Service (DBS) checks had been carried out. The DBS helps employers make safer recruitment  decisions and reduces the risk of unsuitable people from working with vulnerable groups. This showed staff  had been properly checked to make sure they were suitable and safe to work with people.  People who used the service, staff and visitors were protected against the risks of unsafe or unsuitable  premises. We saw evidence of service and inspection records for gas installation, electrical wiring and  portable appliance testing (PAT). A series of risk assessments were in place relating to health and safety.  9 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   Relatives told us they felt confident staff had the skills and knowledge required to support their family  members. One said, ""My [relative] is on a diet and The Lodge are good at helping [them] stay on it. [They  have] done well in keeping to it with help from the staff."" Another relative said, ""They support [my relative] to hospital and for other appointments. [Another relative] goes along too and gets on well with the staff and  thinks they do a good job too.""  Staff we spoke with told us they felt appropriately supported by managers and had supervision every three  months or so, an annual appraisal, and regular staff meetings.   Regular supervision of staff is essential to ensure people are provided with the highest standard of care. We  looked at four staff supervision records and found not all supervision was delivered in line with the  registered provider's policy of two monthly. For one staff member there was no record of supervision in 2016 and only an ad hoc supervision around the specific issue of cleaning in March 2017. A second staff member  had no supervision in their records between September 2016 and October 2017, with the exception of an ad  hoc supervision around the specific issue of food hygiene in December 2016. Neither had an annual  appraisal completed. Following our inspection the registered manager sent us a record of supervision for  the second staff member from May 2017, which still left a gap of five months. This showed staff were not  always receiving regular management supervision to monitor their performance and development needs.  This was a breach of regulation 18 (2) (a) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014.  The registered manager told us she was aware of gaps in supervision and appraisal for some staff and  showed us the supervisions they had planned in October and November 2017. A recent senior staff meeting  record showed senior staff had been asked to add supervision dates to the staff rota.  We saw evidence in staff files to show new staff completed an induction programme when they commenced employment at the service. Staff told us they completed e-learning and face to face training and then  shadowed a more experienced staff member for up to a month if needed. The shadowing focused on getting to know people's individual needs and preferences. A new staff member told us they had been allocated a  learning buddy, who showed them around and provided support. We saw new staff also completed the Care Certificate. The Care Certificate is an introduction to the caring profession and sets out a standard set of  skills, knowledge and behaviours that care workers follow in order to provide high quality, compassionate  care. This demonstrated new employees were supported in their role.   Staff were provided with training and support to ensure they were able to meet people's needs effectively.  We looked at the training records for four staff members and saw they had completed training in areas such  as, infection prevention and control, first aid, food hygiene, autism awareness, Mental Capacity Act 2005  (MCA) and Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS), and safeguarding adults. Staff told us and we saw from  records they also completed three days of face to face training in preventing and managing behaviour that   10 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  challenges, and this was updated annually. Staff told us they were supported to update their training and  complete nationally recognised level two and three qualifications in health and social care. The training  matrix showed which staff had undertaken training and highlighted training that was due to be refreshed  and we saw certificates in staff files to confirm the relevant training had been completed. This demonstrated people were supported by suitably qualified staff with the knowledge and skills to fulfil their role.  The MCA provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the  mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible, people make their own  decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to take particular  decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as possible.  People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this is in their  best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care homes  and hospitals are called DoLS.   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. Six people were subject to DoLS  authorisations, some of which had conditions attached, and one person had been assessed as having the  mental capacity to decide to live at the home.  Staff at the service had completed training and had a good understanding of the MCA. One staff member  told us about one person, who had been assessed as having mental capacity to choose to go out alone.  They said staff could explain the risks but if they chose to go they could not stop the person, as they  understood the risk and could make their own decisions. The service had also requested a mental capacity  assessment and best interest discussion with the person's social worker, to ensure the person understood a  particular decision related to their visits to a friend's house, and to ensure appropriate decision-making  support and information was provided for the person.  It was clear from observations people's autonomy, choices and human rights were promoted. We saw in the  care records we sampled mental capacity assessments had been completed for people in relation to the  decision to live at the home, the administration of medicines, and the decision to accept personal care. We  saw examples of good practice in mental capacity and best interest processes where representatives had  been consulted in relation to health interventions, restrictions in a person's diet due to health conditions,  and whether to reduce or stop smoking.  Two people's mental capacity assessments stated they lacked capacity to consent to the administration of  their medicines by staff, however there was no record of their representative being consulted in their best  interests and the assessment was signed by the registered manager only. The registered manager told us  this decision had been discussed with people's representative and they would record best interest  discussions with the person and their representative to evidence this.   People at The Lodge were supported to have sufficient to eat and drink and to maintain a balanced diet.  One person said, ""I like the meals that I get here. I get a choice if I don't like something.""  A relative said, ""My [relative] enjoys the food. [My relative] prefers home cooked food to takeaways. The  Lodge does provide for [my relative's] religious needs though."" Staff told us they cooked the main meals and some people who used the service joined in with preparation.  Some people were able to help themselves to a drink or a snack, whilst others needed careful monitoring of  all dietary in-take due to health conditions.  11 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  Meals were planned around the tastes and preferences of people who used the service. Each person had a  list of food likes and dislikes in their care records, which was used to inform meal planning. We saw the  individual dietary and cultural requirements of people were catered for, for example, one person was living  with diabetes and one person required specific food-stuffs to meet the requirements of their faith.    Meals were recorded in people's daily records. This included a record of all food consumed, including where  food intake was declined and details of the food eaten, although there were some minor gaps in recording.  People were weighed regularly to keep an overview of any changes in their weight and we saw action was  taken if there were any changes. This showed the service ensured people's nutritional needs were  monitored and action taken if required.  Kitchen refrigerator temperatures were higher than recommended on the two days prior to our inspection  and the action taken to reduce these had not proved effective. The registered manager told us she was  trialling a system recommended by their estates advisor to use bottled water to check fridge temperatures,  however the recorded temperature remained above that recommended, even though in one refrigerator the bottled water had iced up. The registered manager told us she would continue to liaise with their estates  team to find an effective system to ensure fridge temperatures were within recommended limits and  purchase new equipment if required.  People had access to external health and care professionals as the need arose. On the first day of our  inspection one person was supported to attend a hospital appointment and another person was visited by  an independent mental capacity advocate. Staff said people attended healthcare appointments and we saw from people's care records a range of health professionals were involved. This had included GPs,  psychiatrists, community nurses, chiropodists, dentists, speech and language therapists, and psychologists.  People also had an up to date health action plan in their care records and a hospital passport. The aim of a  hospital passport is to provide hospital staff with the information they need to know about a person with a  learning disability when they are admitted to hospital. This showed people received additional support  when required for meeting their care and treatment needs.  The atmosphere of both floors of the home was comfortable and homely. There were pictures and  photographs in the communal areas. Maintenance tasks had been completed since the last inspection and  further work was planned. This meant the design and layout of the building was conducive to providing a  homely but safe and practical environment for people who used the service. Some areas were in need of  updating, for example, the kitchen on the upper floor was in need of refurbishment and this had been  flagged up with the registered provider on regular maintenance audits to promote the dignity of people  using the service. The registered manager told us she hoped this would be replaced in the near future.   12 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us the staff were caring. One person said, ""I like it here."" Another person said, ""The Staff are kind  to me. They are taking me to see my [relative] today. They talk nicely to me as well.""  One person's relative we spoke with said, ""The staff seem caring. They regularly ring, even if there's just a  sign of a problem."" Another relative said, ""I've met almost all of the staff and they all seem nice. They must  treat [my relative] well because [my relative's] behaviour has improved so much and that is the first place we see it if [they aren't] happy, or they weren't looking after [my relative] properly."" A third relative said, ""The  staff are very, very nice. They are extremely pleasant. My [relative] loves their room and we have nothing but  praise for The Lodge and its staff team.""  One person told us they did not like living at the home and wanted their own flat. We saw from records this  had been explored with the person in conjunction with community professionals. They also chatted about  all the things they enjoyed doing with staff at the service and clearly had a good relationship with the staff,  who showed empathy with their situation.  Positive caring relationships were developed through staff understanding people's needs and their  personalities. It was clear from our discussion with staff they knew all about the people they supported and  enjoyed supporting them. One staff member said, ""Yes I like it. I enjoyed going abroad with [name of  person]. It was lovely to be able to do that with [person]."" Another staff member said, ""I love it."" And a third  staff member said the best thing about the service was, ""These guys [who live here]"" A fourth staff member  said, ""Yes I enjoy it. Making residents happy. The residents are all happy. Even [name of person] on a good  day. They all like living here. The residents give you a hug.""  People told us they had been consulted about the care provided for them and we saw staff asked  permission before delivering care. People or their representatives were involved in care planning and  reviews where possible and staff used their knowledge of peoples' individual preferences to plan their  support.  There was a friendly and homely atmosphere and some people enjoyed banter, chatting, laughing and  singing with staff. Staff spoke with people respectfully, as equals and people were included in conversations  and discussions.  Staff were respectful of people's privacy; they knocked on people's doors and asked permission to enter.  Staff told us they kept people covered during personal care and ensured doors and curtains were closed.  People wore clothes and accessories in keeping with their personal style and preferences and staff  complemented them on their appearance or clothing to promote self-esteem.  People were supported to make choices and decisions about their daily lives. Staff used speech, gestures,  sign language, photographs and facial expressions to support people to make choices according to their  communication needs. Information was presented in easy read formats to promote good communication,  and care plans contained details of how to recognise when a person was unhappy or happy using non-  13 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  verbal cues. One staff member said they showed people food items from the kitchen to support them to  choose what they might like to eat.  People's individual rooms were personalised to their taste, for example people had their personal items,  photographs, DVDs and games arranged in a way they liked and had chosen their own bedding and wall  colour. Personalising bedrooms helps staff to get to know a person and helps to create a sense of familiarity  and make a person feel more comfortable.   People were encouraged to do things for themselves in their daily life. We saw from records people took part in their laundry and cleaning their own rooms; they also helped to prepare snacks and drinks, and cook  main meals on occasion. Care plans detailed what people could do for themselves and where they might  need prompting or support. This showed people were encouraged to maintain their independence.   People's diverse needs were catered for and equality was promoted within the service. One person was  supported to take part in festivals with their family, as well as enjoying their cultural heritage.  Care plans showed people were supported with their gender and sexuality choices. We saw staff had  completed equality and diversity training and staff demonstrated an understanding of people's diverse  needs and personal preferences and the difficulties they may face in expressing these. Staff told us they  would respect people's diverse needs by ensuring they understood the person through their care plan,  talking with them or their families and supporting their cultural and personal life choices. Each of the care  records noted if people had a preference for the gender of the care worker who supported them. This  demonstrated the service respected people's individual preferences.  Staff were aware of how to access advocacy services for people if the need arose and some people had an  independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA). An advocate is a person who is able to speak on a person's  behalf, when they may not be able to do so for themselves.   People and their representatives had been consulted regarding end of life plans and wishes, where  appropriate, and these were recorded if they wished.  14 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us they were supported to make decisions about their daily life and were consulted on every  aspect of their support. One person said, ""I like going out for walks, or a drive up to my [relatives']. I also like  going out on my bike."" Another person said, ""I'm going on holiday soon. Blackpool.""  The staff we spoke with had a good awareness of the support needs and preferences of the people who  used the service. We found care plans were person-centred and explained how people liked to be  supported. Entries in the care plans we looked at included, ""What's important to me"", ""It is important that I  am given time to get ready on a morning as I like to take pride in my appearance and I like to smell nice.""  This helped care staff to know what was important to the people they cared for and helped them take  account of this information when delivering their care. We found staff were aware of this information and  people were supported according to their preferences.  We looked at four people's care plans. Care plans were very person-centred and contained detailed  information covering areas such as evening routine, mobility, living safely and taking risks, hygiene,  communication, medication, everyday tasks, decision-making, money, family and relationships, and sleep.  They included long term goals the person was working toward, such as 'Use the bus with staff support.' The  person whose care plan this was told us, ""I had a [health] check today. I came back on the bus. I went with  [name of staff]."" Care plans contained information in an accessible format with photographs of staff and the  person to support involvement.  Care plans also contained detailed information about people's individual behaviour management plans,  including details of how staff would care for people when they exhibited behaviours that challenged, and  the de-escalation techniques staff should use. When we spoke with members of staff they were aware of this  information. This showed the service responded to changes in the behaviour of people who used the service and put plans in place to reduce future risks.  The manager told us, and we saw from records, reviews were held regularly and care plans were reviewed  and updated regularly or when needs changed. These reviews helped monitor whether care records were up to date and reflected people's current needs so that any necessary actions could be identified at an early  stage. We discussed two minor recording issues regarding nutrition and the consistency of foods which  required clarification and the registered manager told us she would clarify this with the professionals  involved. The staff we spoke with knew about people's nutritional needs and the consistency of their food.  Daily records were also kept detailing what activities people had undertaken, what food had been eaten,  their mood and any incidents.   One person's relative said, ""My [relation] goes out most weeks. They take [them] out here, there and  everywhere. [They] could probably do with more activities and exercise though as [they're] putting weight  on. [They] definitely have more of a social life living at The Lodge and [they're] living with other service users, which has really helped [my relative]. [They go] out for lunch and [they] love to shop."" Another relative said,   15 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  ""My [relative] does woodwork, [they] go out for walks, and on their bike. They (the staff) take [my relative]  out for meals sometimes as well.""  We saw staff at The Lodge were responsive to people's needs, asking them questions about what they  wanted to do and planned future activities. Staff were patient with people, and listened to their responses.  This meant that the choices of people who used the service were respected.  Staff spoke with good insight into people's personal interests and we saw from people's support plans they  were given opportunities to pursue hobbies and activities of their choice. For example one staff member  told us they had a season ticket to support a person to go to football matches and they had helped them to  get their own bike from a local charity that recycles bikes for people to use. We heard how people were  being assisted to lead fulfilling lives and picked the things they wanted to take part in.  On the first day of our inspection one person was being supported to visit family members; another person  was going to an appointment and lunch, a third person was out at day centre, a fourth person was out  visiting friends without support, and a fifth person was listening to music in their room and then went for a  long walk in line with their recorded preferences.   Two people didn't go out of the home on the first day of our inspection. One person was using table top  items in the dining area with staff support and the other person spent time chatting with staff and resting in  their room. This person asked to go out and their care plan stated they enjoyed accessing the community.  Their activity time table for the day of our inspection said, ""Outing/lunch out/picnic."" We looked at the  person's activity records and found they had not been out of the home in the six days prior to our inspection.  We asked the registered manager about this and she told us the person was awaiting a social work  assessment for extra support hours, as their behaviour had deteriorated when out of the house and they  now needed two staff or one staff member very familiar and experienced with their needs, to accompany  them to maintain safety. This meant the person could not go out that day as the experienced staff member  had to stay in the building to support the other two staff members. The registered manager walked with the  person to the local garage to buy some sweets after our discussion and told us she would again follow up  the re-assessment. We looked at three other people's activity records and saw they were involved in regular activities inside and outside the home in line with their care plans.  Records showed each person had an individually planned holiday. One person's care plan detailed their  goal of going abroad on an aeroplane for the first time and we found this had now been achieved and they  had enjoyed their holiday.  One person said, ""[My relatives] visit me here."" Care plans contained a relationship circle for each person, so  staff knew which people were important to them. Staff told us and we saw from records how they enabled  people to see their families as often as they desired. This meant staff supported people with their social  needs.   The relatives we spoke with told us staff were always approachable and they were able to raise any  concerns. One relative said, ""The staff answer queries promptly."" People's views were sought by the  registered manager through meetings and one-to one conversations. We saw there was an easy read  complaints procedure in people's care files. Staff we spoke with said if a person wished to make a complaint they would facilitate this. The registered manager showed us there had been no formal complaints since our last inspection. They were clear about their responsibilities to respond to and investigate any concerns   16 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  received. Compliments had been received from family members and community professionals and fed back to staff at team meetings  17 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People told us the service was well-led. One person said, ""The manager is [name] and she's nice to me.""   A relative said, ""There is always a nice atmosphere when I've visited The Lodge. The manager is  approachable, in fact, all the staff are. We have no concerns at all."" A second relative said, ""No, I don't know  the manager sorry. My [relative] hasn't been there very long. The three or four staff I have met have all  seemed very nice though."" A third relative said, ""I've not spoken to the manager so I don't know who it is.  There has always been a nice atmosphere when I've visited and we are made to feel welcome by the staff.  They've had renovations recently and [my relative] likes things like that so [they're] happy.""  There was a registered manager in post who had been registered since June 2016. She had been asked by  the registered provider to manage two services since July 2017 and now spent two days at the other service  and three days a week at The Lodge. As a deputy manager was no longer in post at the second service the  registered manager had minimal management support with either service. The registered manager told us  she was finding it difficult to complete all the management tasks required for both services. The registered  provider had arranged for a temporary deputy manager to provide some management support at the  second service the week after our inspection for three days a week.  Each shift at The Lodge was led by a senior support worker, who completed some management tasks such  as medicines and financial audits.  Staff told us they felt supported by the registered manager and senior team, who always acted on their  concerns. One staff member said, ""[The registered manager] is a very good manager. Very approachable.""  Another staff member said, ""She is a good one. She looks after us."" Staff told us representatives of the  registered provider were also approachable.   At our last inspection in July 2016 we found the registered provider was not meeting the regulation related  to good governance because an effective system to improve the quality and safety of the service was not in  place, and the home was in a poor state of repair. At this inspection we checked and found improvements  had been made, although we found a new breach of the regulation related to staff supervision. This meant  an improvement in governance was still required.  The registered provider had introduced a new system across all its services to ensure all management  information was kept in one place and was easily accessible. The new system included a walk through audit  of the building. We saw audits were maintained in relation to premises and equipment. There was evidence  of internal daily, weekly and monthly quality audits and actions identified who was responsible and by  which date. Care plans and documents were also reviewed and audited regularly. Daily audits were  completed on finances, and medicine stocks were checked three times a day. Building safety and cleaning  audits had been improved and we saw action was taken when issues arose.  The registered manager had an overview of audits and regularly recorded checks to ensure action had been   18 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  taken if required. There were gaps in some recent weekly and monthly medicines audits and checks on the  contents of first aid kits. The registered manager told us this was due to a reduction in management time  and said she would address this as soon as possible. Following our inspection the registered manager  showed us they had addressed the gaps with staff and ensured audits were completed. This meant they  were taking action to improve the service.  The registered provider had recently introduced policy knowledge checks with staff in areas such as  medicines, confidentiality, fire safety and safeguarding policy to ensure staff knowledge was up to date. This showed staff compliance with the registered provider's procedures was monitored.   Information was passed to the registered provider in a monthly report in areas including incidents and  accidents, safeguarding, training compliance and staff supervision. The locality manager visited the home  regularly to provide support and to complete audits and ensure compliance with the provider's policies and  procedures.   The registered manager had addressed issues as they arose, such as the recording of fridge temperatures  and cleaning up spillages, in ad hoc supervision with staff and at staff meetings. We saw from a medicines  audit in September 2017 gaps in recording had been followed up with staff. A monthly kitchen audit was  completed however on the second day of our inspection we found there were gaps in the recording of fridge  temperatures in the upper floor kitchen for the last five days. The registered manager said they would  address this with staff.  The registered manager told us she felt supported by the provider, and was able to contact a senior  manager at any time for support. The registered manager worked to an action plan completed in  conjunction with the locality manager and we saw action had been completed within the timescales set.  This demonstrated the senior management of the organisation were reviewing information to drive up  quality in the organisation, although this system had not effectively addressed the issue we found in relation to staff supervision.  The registered manager could demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of the needs and preferences of the  people at The Lodge. She said her aim was for people to ""Live an independent and normal life and to do  what they want to do."" The registered manager told us she attended monthly managers' meetings, training  and events to keep up to date with good practice, and they were currently completing a level 5 qualification  in care management. This meant they were open to new ideas and keen to learn from others to achieve the  best possible outcomes for people using the service.  The service worked in partnership with community health professionals and commissioners and we saw  they worked together to meet people's needs and drive up the quality of the service. Two compliments had  been received from health professionals regarding the detailed care plans and health records kept by the  service, although we received feedback from another community professional following our inspection that  sufficient information was not available in records for them to complete an accurate assessment for one  person.  People who used the service and their representatives were asked for their views about the service and  these were acted upon. A house meeting had been held in June 2017 and topics discussed included  safeguarding, holidays, food choices, happiness with the service and having a barbeque. Photographs of  meals and holidays were used at meetings to support people's choices. Staff told us they struggled to get  some people to take part in group discussions and house meetings were infrequent.  19 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  People who used the service and their families were also consulted about the service on an individual basis.  Questionnaires were no longer sent out to family members every year by the registered provider and the  registered manager said it was now the individual home that sent these out and this had not yet been  completed, although feedback had been received verbally and by email from relatives in the form of  compliments. The registered manager said they would be sending out questionnaires to families in the near  future.  Staff meetings had been held on average every three months. Topics discussed included staff training,  completing kitchen checks, individual resident's needs, safeguarding, medicines policy, staffing and the  rota, and the last Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection. Staff meetings are an important part of the  provider's responsibility in monitoring the service and coming to an informed view as to the standard of care for people living at the home.  The registered manager understood her responsibilities with respect to the submission of statutory  notifications to the CQC. Notifications for all incidents which required submission to CQC had been made.  The previous inspection ratings were displayed at the home and a link to the ratings and last inspection  report was available on the registered provider's website. This showed the registered provider was meeting  their requirement to display the most recent performance assessment of their regulated activities and  showed they were open and transparent by sharing and displaying information about the service.  20 The Lodge Inspection report 13 December 2017  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

At the time of our inspection, the home was  fully occupied.  Accommodation is provided over three floors and two rooms have en-suite facilities.  Four  rooms are of shared occupancy.  Communal areas include a large sitting room, small sitting room, dining  room and a small dining area at the end of the kitchen; people have access to gardens at the rear of the  home.  At the last inspection the service was rated Good.  Medicines were not always managed safely and we found areas of concern in relation to the handwritten  Medication Administration Records (MAR), some medicines which were out of date but not disposed of, the  temperature of the room where medicines were stored and the administration of medicines.  We discussed  these issues with the registered manager.  By the second day, the registered manager had begun to take  steps to address our concerns.  A system of audits was in place to measure and monitor the service delivered.  However, these audits were  not effective in identifying the areas of concern we found at inspection.  Care records were not kept securely  at the time of our inspection.  This was raised with the registered manager during the inspection, who  arranged for locks to be installed on the drawers before we returned for our second day, thus keeping  people's personal information confidentially.  Staff were protected from avoidable harm by staff who had been trained in safeguarding adults at risk.   People felt safe living at the home and their risks were identified, assessed and managed in a way to  mitigate risks.  Staffing levels were sufficient to meet people's needs.  Staff had been recruited safely.   Premises were cleaned to an acceptable standard.  Staff completed a range of training to enable them to have the skills and knowledge required to care for  people in an effective way.  Staff received regular supervision with their line managers and attended staff  meetings.  People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and staff supported  them in the least restrictive way possible; the policies and systems in the service supported this practice.   People were happy with the food on offer at the home and had a choice of what they would like to eat.   Healthcare professionals supported people to maintain good health.  We identified some issues in relation  to the bathing facilities and general upkeep of the home.  After the inspection, the registered manager  informed us of actions that would be taken to address these.  Staff were warm, kind and caring with people.  People spoke highly of the caring nature of the staff.  They  were involved in decisions relating to their care, as were their relatives.  People were treated with dignity and respect.  The home had achieved Platinum status for the Gold Standards Framework in relation to their end  of life care.  2 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  Care plans contained detailed, personalised information about people and how they wished to be  supported by staff.  People and their relatives were involved in reviewing their care plans.  An activities co- ordinator arranged activities for people which were individual and reflected people's preferences.  People  were happy with the activities on offer.  The provider had a complaints policy in place.  No formal  complaints had been recorded since October 2015.  People and their relatives spoke positively about the care provided at the home and held the registered  manager and staff in high regard.  Feedback was obtained from people and their relatives about the quality  of care provided and the home overall.  Staff felt supported by management and enjoyed working at the  home.  The registered manager worked in partnership with other agencies.  You can see what action we told the provider to take at the back of the full version of this report.  3 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Requires Improvement    Good    Good    	  Some aspects of the service were unsafe.  Medicines were not managed safely.  Recruitment systems were in place.  People were protected from the risk of harm by staff who had  been trained in safeguarding adults at risk.  People's risks were identified, assessed and managed  appropriately.  Staffing levels were sufficient to meet people's needs.  	  The service was effective.  Staff had completed a range of training to support people; they  were encouraged to study for additional qualifications.  Regular  supervision and staff meetings took place.  Consent to care and treatment was sought in line with legislation and guidance.  Staff understood the requirements of the Mental  Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 and put this into practice.  Menus provided people with a choice of what they wanted to eat. People were encouraged to life a healthy lifestyle and were  supported by a range of healthcare professionals and services.  Some parts of the environment were due to be refurbished.   Following the inspection, the registered manager had improved  the bathing facilities.  	  The service was caring.  People were looked after by kind and caring staff who knew  them well.  4 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  Good    Requires Improvement    As much as they were able, people were involved in decisions  relating to their care, as were their relatives.  People were treated with dignity and respect.  The service had achieved platinum status in the Gold Standards  Framework for end of life care.  	  The service was responsive.  People's care plans provided staff with detailed information  about people and they support they required.  A range of activities was on offer to people living at the home and an activities co-ordinator facilitated these.  Complaints were managed in line with the provider's complaints  policy.  	  Some aspects of the service were not well led.  The audits had failed to identify the areas of concern we found at inspection in relation to the safe management of medicines.   People's records were not kept confidentially and some sensitive information was on display in a communal area.  People and their relatives were positive about the quality of care  provided and were complimentary about the management and  staffing of the home.  People and their relatives were involved in the development of  the home through meetings and their feedback was obtained  through surveys.  5 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018     Rosedale Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions.  This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.   This was an unannounced, comprehensive inspection which took place on 29 August and 1 September  2017.  Two inspectors and an expert by experience undertook this inspection.  An expert by experience is a  person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service.   The  expert by experience had expertise in dementia care.  Before the inspection, the provider completed a Provider Information Return (PIR).  This is a form that asks  the provider to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and any  improvements they plan to make.  We checked the information that we held about the service and the  service provider.  This included previous inspection reports and statutory notifications sent to us by the  registered manager about incidents and events that had occurred at the service.  A notification is  information about important events which the service is required to send to us by law.  We used all this  information to decide which areas to focus on during our inspection.  We observed care and spoke with people, relatives and staff.  We spend time looking at records including six  care records, three staff files, medication administration record (MAR) sheets, staff rotas, the staff training  plan and other records relating to the management of the service.  On the day of our inspection, we spoke with six people living at the service and four relatives.  We chatted  with people where they were able to speak with us and observed them as they engaged with their day-to- day tasks and activities.  We spoke with the registered manager, the deputy manager and two senior care  staff.  6 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018   	  Requires Improvement  	"   Medicines were not always managed safely in relation to storage, administration or disposal.  On the second day of our inspection, we observed care staff administering medicines to people.  When medicines needed  to be administered during the lunchtime period, they were removed from the medicines trolley and placed  into plastic containers.  The plastic containers and other medicines were then put onto a wooden tea trolley  and wheeled from the kitchen area into the main sitting room.  The plastic containers were  placed on the  coffee table which was centrally positioned in the sitting room.  Two staff were involved in the  administration of medicines.  We observed staff administering medicines to people and, for the most part, this was done safely.  However,  we observed one occasion when one of the care staff left the sitting room to administer a medicine to a  person in their bedroom and then returned with the empty medicine pot.  The staff member who signed the  Medication Administration Record (MAR) to confirm the person had taken their medicine, was not the  person who administered it.  This is not good practice and was not in line with the provider's policy in the  administration of medicines, which we later checked.  We discussed this issue with the staff member who  had signed the MAR and with the registered manager, who both agreed this was an oversight and gave us  reassurances it would not happen again.  The registered manager said they would be reminding staff that  whoever administered the medicine to a person also had to sign the MAR in confirmation.  She later  confirmed that this had been discussed both formally and informally with both the individual staff  concerned and the wider staff group.  Some medicines were stored in a medicines trolley which was secured to the wall in a room next to the  kitchen.  The temperature of this room was not routinely monitored.  We asked the registered manager to  check the temperature as it was a warm day and a thermometer was placed on top of the trolley.  A reading  of up to 26 degrees Celsius was obtained, which is in excess of the recommended maximum temperature of  25 degrees Celsius.  We discussed this with the registered manager who agreed to take action to ensure that  the room was ventilated sufficiently or a fan was used, to bring the temperature within normal limits.  During our inspection, we observed that, at times, the key to the medicines trolley was left in a box on top of the  trolley.  This meant that anyone had access to the key and that the medicines were not kept securely.  We  discussed this issue with the registered manager who assured us she would remind staff not to leave the key  on top of the trolley.  She later informed us that she had implemented the use of a lanyard so senior staff  could wear the keys around their neck or lock them away in a key safe.  We checked the MAR for everyone living at the home.  We observed that one medicine that had been  administered to a person at noon and recorded on the MAR, had also been signed as being given at 17.00hrs at 12.30hrs when we looked at the records.  This was inaccurate and we drew this to the attention of the  registered manager who told us that the staff member had become flustered because of the inspection and  had inadvertently signed the MAR.  The registered manager also explained that the member of staff had  immediately realised their mistake and had drawn it to the registered manager's attention.  The registered  manager then made a note on the MAR to alert the member of staff who would be carrying out the next  administration of medicines.  The first member of staff also alerted the member of staff who would be   7 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  carrying out the 5.00pm administration of medicines.  That member of staff also saw the registered  manager's note.  At 5.00pm, the member of staff administered the correct dose appropriately.  We saw that the MAR for two people had been handwritten by one staff member, but had not been checked  by another staff member to confirm it had been correctly completed.  The National Institute for Health and  Care Excellence guidance, ' Managing medicines for adults receiving social care in the community' (NG67),  states that, 'Care home providers should ensure that a new, hand-written medicines administration record  is produced only in exceptional circumstances and is created by a member of care home staff with the  training and skills for managing medicines and designated responsibility for medicines in the care home.  The  new record should be checked for accuracy and signed by a second trained and skilled member of staff  before it is first used'.  There was nothing on the handwritten MAR we looked at to confirm that this had  been checked by a second member of staff.  This meant that medicines were at risk of being recorded  inaccurately.  In one hand-written MAR, it stated, 'Clonazepam 0.25mg ½ tablet twice a day PRN.  Please ask  her and record overleaf'.  However, nothing had been recorded on the reverse of the MAR, that is, whether  this person had been asked if they required this medicine or not.  For the same person we saw that two  medicines, Aripiprazole and Cyanocobal recorded on the MAR had been crossed out, with no explanation as  to why.  In another handwritten MAR we read that a person had been prescribed an inhaler for  breathlessness, 'Two puffs up to four times a day – record overleaf', but there was no indication as to  whether the person required this medicine on a regular basis or 'when required'.  On another MAR, we saw  that eye drops for one person had been refused by them for a period of eight consecutive days, but no  action was taken until we discussed this with the registered manager, who then consulted the person's GP.  We looked at weekly medicines audits, which recorded the date, any concerns and who had checked the  medicines, but there was no information or detail on what had been checked to confirm that medicines  were managed safely.  After the inspection, the registered manager told us they had revamped the  medicines audits to include a higher level of detail.  Some medicines which had been stored in the trolley were out of date.  For example, some suppositories  which showed an expiry date of 05/17, vapour drops which had an expiry date of August 2016 and  Lorazepam which showed an expiry date of 04/16.  In addition, there was a homely remedy within the trolley for one person who was no longer living at the home.  The registered manager disposed of these medicines  when asked.  The above evidence shows that medicines were not managed safely.  This is a breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Following the inspection, the registered manager told us of the actions they had taken to address the  concerns we raised.    Homely remedies were used when required and the provider had a policy in place which provided guidance  to staff on the safe use of homely remedies.  Homely remedies that might be used included painkillers such  as paracetamol, indigestion and constipation remedies and cough linctus.  All creams that were for topical  use were prescribed for people.  Staff had completed training in the administration of medicines.  People had their medicines reviewed at  least annually by their GP.  Medicines were ordered in a timely fashion.  Staff were observed in the  administration of medicines by senior staff and their competencies checked.  We asked people whether they received their medicines when they needed them.  One person said, ""Yes and  8 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  I manage them myself.  I am offered pain relief; staff look after us very well"".  Another person told us, ""I don't  really have any medication; I've never needed it"".  A third person said, ""Yes, staff do it.  I always used to do it  before I came here"".  People were protected from avoidable harm by staff who had been trained to recognise the signs of  potential abuse and knew what action to take.  We discussed a safeguarding concern with the registered  manager which related to a person who had been the subject of an alleged abuse before they moved into  Rosedale Care Home.  The registered manager assured us she would take action to ensure the relevant  safeguarding authority were informed of this incident.  We asked people whether they felt safe at the home. One person described an incident where another  person had hit them with a newspaper. Staff had taken immediate action and helped the person. As a result, if the person became worried or concerned, they could ring a portable call bell which staff had given to  them; this helped them to feel safe. Another person said, ""Yes, I think so. I don't know, I'm just safe. I'm quite  safe from other residents"". A third person told us, ""I've never met anyone bad. I feel quite safe. We are well  looked after"". A relative said, ""It's the best thing for her because I know she's safe"". A staff member, when  asked about safeguarding explained, ""We talk about helping people to feel safe and valued, to end up with  person centred care"". The deputy manager was also the person-centred safeguarding champion and had  completed additional training with a team from the local authority. This training focused on ensuring that  the home had a person-centred ethos, which would help provide better care and prevent abuse. They told  us about the different types of abuse and signs that might indicate abuse. In addition to mandatory training  in relation to safeguarding, staff also engaged more interactively in training at team meeting.'  Risks to people were managed so that people were protected.  We asked people whether they were involved in making decisions about any risks they might want to take.  One person said, ""I do things for myself you  know. They do their best to make sure the place is safe and the security is good.  I am very careful.  I can  access where I want to go. I'm not taking any chances and doing anything stupid"".  A second person told us,  ""If I need help I ask.  I'm quite happy indoors"".  We looked at a range of risk assessments contained within  people's care plans.  These included people's risk of malnutrition, pressure areas, moving and handling,  medicines, falls and health issues.  Plans had been drawn up to provide information to staff on what action  to take should people need to be evacuated in the event of an emergency.  The registered manager told us  they had an agreement with the care home next door should people require a safe place to be evacuated to. In the event of an electricity failure, a generator could be used as back-up.  Risk assessments in relation to  premises and safety of equipment had all been completed appropriately.  There were sufficient numbers of suitable staff to keep people safe and meet their needs.  The registered  manager told us they never needed to use agency staff as permanent staff could work flexibly when  required.   People felt there were enough staff to meet their needs overall.  One person said, ""The staff are  busy so naturally you have to wait sometimes; they are dedicated.  I do think sometimes at night they need a third person.  I don't know if they have agency staff"".  A second person told us, ""Normally they are quite  good.  If I want the toilet in the night I just ring and they are there"".  Staff too felt staffing levels were  sufficient.  The deputy manager explained, ""[Named registered manager] is really responsive when it comes  to staffing levels.  We try and offer a home for life and people's conditions change.  Staff can go to the  manager if they feel more staff are needed.  At busy times of day there are always staff around"".  We looked  at staffing rotas over a four week period.  These confirmed that there were four staff on duty during the  morning and three care staff in the afternoons.  At night, two care staff were on duty, one awake and one  sleeping.  The registered manager said, ""I don't believe in very long shifts, so my staff tend to do between  three and five hour shifts.  Staff are flexible, so they can come in early or leave late"".  9 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  We looked at staff files and at the recruitment processes that were followed when new staff came to work at  the home. The registered manager said, ""I recruit depending on when I have a vacancy, but we don't often  have vacancies"".  Staff were checked on their suitability to work in care through checks with the Disclosure  and Barring Service and references obtained.  The registered manager had satisfied herself that employees  were fit and proper persons for the jobs they were employed to undertake.   We looked around the home and generally the premises were clean and odour free.  10 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People we spoke with felt that staff had the knowledge and skills they needed to carry out their roles and  responsibilities.  Staff completed a range of mandatory training including moving and handling,  safeguarding, infection control, mental capacity and deprivation of liberty, dementia, including Dementia  Friends and training in relation to end of life.  We checked the staff training plan which showed that staff had completed their training as required.  One staff member said, ""Every month we have an update to training,  like recently we had safeguarding training"".  Another staff member told us, ""They make the training really  fun, especially first aid.  It makes it simple.  You can always ask if you're not sure.  [Named registered  manager] encourages staff to do learning"".  Staff were also encouraged to study for additional qualifications  such as diplomas in health and social care.  On the first day of our inspection, we met with an assessor from  a local college who told us that staff were, 'good' and that four staff had just completed their diplomas.   Some staff had also completed additional training and were 'champions' of particular areas such as, end of  life, infection control, moving and handling, safeguarding and dementia.  Champions used their training and knowledge in their specialist areas to advise and guide other staff where needed.  Staff received regular supervision from their line managers and these were completed every six months.   Staff supervision records we looked at showed that various topics were discussed including, a review of the  staff member's work performance, training, support and development, work targets and standards required, personal needs and matters arising and any other issues relating to work performance.  The deputy  manager said, ""We also use staff meetings as group supervisions.  We do informal supervisions all the time  and are constantly observing.  Staff always have someone to talk to"".  Staff meetings were generally held on  every 2nd Tuesday of the month and the agenda was compiled by staff.  The deputy manager said, ""We go  over the minutes of the last meeting and check that actions have been taken"".  We looked at a staff meeting  record for 11 July 2017 at which the minutes of the previous meeting were discussed, inspection and  residents.  The registered manager told us, ""Staff meeting minutes go out with staff payslips, so no-one can  say they're not aware of what's going on"".  One staff member told us, ""I love my job.  I get up in the morning  and look forward to coming.  It's like a big family.  If I can make one person smile and laugh, I can go home  happy"".  People who lack mental capacity to consent to arrangements for necessary care or treatment can only be  deprived of their liberty when this is in their best interests and legally authorised under the Mental Capacity  Act 2005 (MCA).  The procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty  Safeguards (DoLS).  We looked at capacity assessments for a range of people.  These were not detailed, but  provided enough basic information for the local authority to make a decision in relation to whether they  should be subject to a DoLS.  We looked at records for one person whose DoLS had been authorised.   However, there was backlog of assessments which had been submitted to the local authority and were  awaiting authorisation/refusal.  Where people's relatives had been granted power of attorney over their  affairs, paperwork was copied and placed within people's care plans to show relatives could make decisions on their family member's behalf in relation to finances and/or health and welfare.  One relative who had  power of attorney said, ""My mother hasn't got the capacity to make her own decisions; she will agree to  suggestions"".  11 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  Staff we spoke with had a good understanding of the MCA.  One staff member said, ""Everyone has mental  capacity unless proved otherwise and may need support to make decisions"".  They talked about best  interest decisions and the importance of documentation to support any decisions taken on a person's  behalf.  When asked about DoLS, this staff member said, ""If they don't have capacity and want to go out on  their own we need to put a DoLS in place"".  We asked staff about whether they ever restrained people.  The  provider had a policy in place in relation to the use of restraint.  The deputy manager told us, ""We don't  physically intervene"" and described the use of distractions and acceptable interventions that might be used  with people who displayed behaviour perceived as challenging.  We asked people whether they were happy with the food at Rosedale Care Home.  One person said, ""I am  happy with the food and we get a choice; we get more than enough, no problem there.  I don't have a  special diet, but I have coffee whenever I want it.  I drank tea all my life and then I couldn't take it any more –  most strange!  On Sunday lunch, I have  a small sherry, but I've never been a drinker"".  A second person told  us, ""There's plenty of it and I eat most things"".  A third person said, ""The food is all right, but I'm not a big  eater.  Cups of tea are regular and I like fresh juice.  It's there if I want it"".  We looked at the menus which  provided choice for people.  The registered manager said, ""People have choices.  We know people's likes  and dislikes"".  For people at risk of malnourishment or who were underweight, food was fortified with butter  and cream.  Staff who cooked meals had also been on training in relation to the management of people's  nutritional needs.  A relative said, ""Mum is diabetic and needs staff to make sure she eats properly"".  Another  relative told us, ""She's eating and drinking, which she wasn't before she came to live here.  Now she eats  everything they put in front of her"".  Special diets were catered for as required, for example, for people living  with diabetes, gluten or lactose intolerance.  Nutrition care plans had been drawn up for people and their  food preferences recorded.  People had regular access to healthcare professionals and services.  We asked people whether they saw a  GP at the home.  One person said, ""Yes, there's no problem there and they come round once a week anyway. I don't need a dentist"".  A second person told us, ""I've never seen a doctor since I've been here, but if I  needed one, I would ask"".  A third person said, ""The doctor in the home spoke to the home staff not me"".  We could not establish whether this person had been seen by the GP or whether they had thought the GP was  visiting them when in fact they were seeing another resident.  We met with the GP who was visiting the home on their regular weekly visit.  They told us, ""I've been coming here since October last year, once a week.  It's  the very best residential care home I've ever stepped in.  [Named registered manager] is very interactive with her staff.  They are very good at self-managing and only ring when they need to"".  A healthcare assistant was  also visiting on the day of our inspection and told us, ""It's always very friendly and everyone is very well  cared for.  They will ask our advice and take on board anything we advise"".  The deputy manager told us that people had access to the GP, district nurses, optician, dentists and chiropodists and care records recorded  these health visits and outcomes.  Where required, referrals were made to other healthcare professionals,  such as speech and language therapists or tissue viability nurses.  We asked people whether they were involved in decisions relating to the environment.  One person said,  ""Well  we have meetings from time to time and have chance to put forward any complaints"".  A second  person told us, ""I'm sure they would ask us if they needed to"".  We observed that the carpet in the large  sitting room was worn and in need of replacement.  The registered manager told us that a new carpet was  on order and would be fitted soon.  A staff member, when asked about the environment, said, ""It's a home.   It might not be colour co-ordinated and things may be a bit shabby, but it's homely"".  We looked at the  bathing facilities available to people.  Two people had en-suite rooms and the other 16 residents had access to one bathroom and one shower room.  People we spoke with were not concerned about the bathing  facilities and felt they were adequate.  We saw that a bathroom adjacent to one of the ground floor rooms  was not in use and was cluttered with old equipment and furniture.  Another bathroom located on the first   12 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  floor contained unwanted items of furniture such as an old TV, armchair, foam mattress and overlap table.   This bathroom was not in use.  A second bathroom on the first floor, containing a bath and shower, was  used.  However, only the bath was working as a pair of stepladders placed in the shower cubicle prevented it from being used as it needed repairing.  There was a walk-in shower room on the ground floor.  We asked  relatives for their comments on the availability of baths and showers to people.  One relative said, ""[Named  person] has a shower or bath every Monday, that's her slot.  It is only once a week usually, but that is what  she wanted"".  A second relative told us, ""She prefers a bath, but she told me last week she had a shower"".   One person said, ""You have to share with other people.  There is only one shower"".  The deputy manager  said, ""We talk to the residents.  People choose bath or showers in the morning or evening, we all work  together.  It's always people's choice"".  We discussed the access to bathing facilities that were available to  people and of the bathrooms that were not in use.  After the inspection, the registered manager informed us  they were clearing out one of the bathrooms so it would be functional, together with a second shower.  13 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People were looked after by kind and caring staff.  We asked people for their comments about the staff at  Rosedale Care Home.  One person said, ""Oh yes, they're dedicated to the job, I think so.  I believe in God and  someone would take me to church if I wished it"".  A second person told us that staff were very caring and, ""I  couldn't be in a better place"".  A third person agreed that staff were warm and friendly.  A relative said they  were always made to feel welcome and offered a cup of tea, adding, ""It's home from home"".  Another  relative told us, ""Mum's keyworker is lovely.  Some carers are better than others"".  A third relative said, ""I  have nothing but admiration for staff"".  We observed staff spending time with people.  For example, a member of staff was sitting next to one person in their room, assisting them to eat their lunch.  We spoke to the staff member, who then introduced us to  the person they were assisting.  We observed the staff member was attentive and caring towards the person. It was clear that they knew each other very well and were enjoying each other's company.  The deputy  manager gave their feedback about the home and said, ""It's the atmosphere and the culture.  It's hard to  write down on a piece of paper.  When you walk through the door you can sense the atmosphere and staff  are friendly"".  On the second day of our inspection we observed one member of care staff asking people if  they would like a hug; lots of people did.  People also cared about each other and during the lunch period,  we observed one person encouraging another to eat their lunch in a very friendly and warm manner.  We asked people whether they were involved in decisions relating to their care.  One person said, ""I think so. They already know about me, it's all in my notes"".  A second person told us, ""They would if I had a complaint, but I've got nothing to complain about.  I'm not fussy"".  A third person said, ""I think my likes and dislikes are  considered a little.  Sometimes I just feel I'm another client"".  Relatives told us they were kept fully informed  about their family member's care.  One relative explained, ""They always inform me of anything, like  shopping I need to get.  They phoned me the other day about the 'flu jab"".  They added that their family  member always contributed to any decisions relating to their care.  People were treated with dignity by staff who understood how to respect people.  Referring to dignity, the  deputy manager said, ""Staff are really aware.  When we say 'dignity', it's about covering people up,  encouraging people to do things for themselves, the environment, making sure people have their hearing  aids, for example.  Some people need support from staff to be themselves"".  The deputy manager said that  the topic of treating people with dignity and respect was often discussed at staff meetings.  A member of  care staff said, ""We give people a choice, listen to what they want and encourage independence' it's a  person-centred approach"".  A third staff member told us, ""We always say what we're doing, keep people  covered and clothed.  Doors are closed and staff knock.  We never leave people sitting on a commode.  You  treat people how you would want your mum to be treated"".  Some people were accommodated in shared rooms; four rooms at the home were of double occupancy.  To some extent, people could maintain their privacy as there were curtains which could be drawn round the  bed.  However, these did not extend sufficiently to provide privacy for people when they wanted to use the  washbasin in their room, for example, if they wanted to wash or clean their teeth.  14 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  The home had been recognised in their end of life care and had recently achieved Platinum status for the  Gold Standards Framework (GSF), an accreditation which recognised the high standards of care in relation  to caring for people at the end of their lives.  Where possible, people had contributed to making advanced  care plans which included their last wishes.  In the Provider Information Return (PIR), the registered manager stated, 'Rosedale's advanced care planning process is approved and carried out in collaboration with our  site GP and all staff are trained in or have a good awareness of advanced care planning by the registered  manager who has formal training and assessing qualifications'.  The registered manager felt that ensuring  people had a comfortable, pain-free and dignified death was important and said, ""We're very keen, not only  as being a specialist area for us, but as career progression for staff"".  A relative told us their family member  had visited their GP to discuss their 'Do Not Attempt Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation' (DNACPR) form.   DNACPR forms are completed when it is felt that, to resuscitate a person in the event of heart failure, would  be futile and likely to be unsuccessful.  DNACPRs that we looked at had been completed with the  involvement of people where possible, and their relatives.  Staff told us that, if it was their wish, people  would spend their last days at Rosedale Care Home, rather than be admitted to hospital or into a nursing  home.  One person, when asked what they wanted in relation to end of life care said, ""I would just go along  with it.  Staff would do what they could for me"".  Another person told us, ""You spend your life saying  goodbye to people; I'm the only one left now"".  A relative commented that staff knew people very well and  cared about them, even travelling to Essex for one person's funeral.  A GP told us that when people were coming to the end of their lives, their needs would be discussed and  anticipatory medicines procured as needed.  15 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People received personalised care that was responsive to their needs.  We looked at care plans which were  detailed and contained personal information about people.  For example, a document entitled, 'This Is Me'  provided information about people before they came into the home, what their lives were like, their likes,  dislikes and preferences, including their spiritual needs.  Care plans provided guidance to staff on people's  care and support needs including their personal care needs, mobility, nutrition, skin integrity, day and night- time routines.  The deputy manager told us, ""Staff do read care plans.  They look at them if they have  concerns about something or need guidance – it's all there"".  The deputy manager added, ""We have an  annual review with people about their care plan.  Keyworkers see people every morning and they  understand people.  Sometimes it can be the most intimate 1:1 time during the day.  Any problems can be  addressed"".  A relative said, ""I think I have seen my mum's care plan and it's due for review.  We had a  meeting about dementia once"".  Another relative told us they met to review their family member's care plan  twice a year to discuss this.  They added that they had been involved in preparing a personal profile or life  history of their family member and that this was kept in their room.  They added, ""Mum wanted her own  bedding and the staff keep to that"".  We asked people whether they were involved in reviewing their care plans.  One person said, ""Yes, they go  through my care plan, but I have no family.  I have good friends who are my next of kin"".  Another person was not sure whether they had seen their care plan and told us, ""I don't think so.  If need be I think my family  would be involved"".  People and their relatives all spoke highly of the care provided at Rosedale Care Home  and of the responsive nature of staff to meet their  needs.  Staff at the home did not wear uniforms; as one  staff member said, ""We don't wear uniforms because this is people's home"".  This helped to prevent any  barriers occurring between people and staff and promoted equality in the relationships that had been  developed.  An activities co-ordinator helped to plan and engage with people in a range of activities.  The registered  manager had arranged for them to undertake training specifically designed in how to provide meaningful  activities for older people, including people living with dementia.  The registered manager told us that there  was, ""Something happening every day of the week"".  An activities calendar we saw showed that people  could join in with board games, arts and crafts, 'active games', exercises, pampering and reminiscence.  A  hairdresser visited the home regularly and was present on the day of our inspection.  We observed that  people enjoyed having their hair washed and styled and felt better for the experience.  The registered  manager said, ""Staff take people out, for example, to go shopping.  A lot of people have very supportive  families who also take them out, but I would like to do more outings"".  We observed the activities co- ordinator spent time sitting with people and that activities were organised in line with people's preferences. A relative, referring to their family member, said, ""She's got company all the time; there's always someone  around.  She does quizzes, but doesn't like arts and crafts.  She likes music and sings"".  We observed people  in the large sitting room, relaxed and happy, enjoying activities such as jigsaws, dominos, crosswords or  reading the newspaper.  We asked people if they knew how to make a complaint if they had any concerns.  One person said, ""I would   16 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  go to [named the providers].  I do feel they would take it seriously and the staff as well.  We're well looked  after"".  Another person told us, ""I would ask the head person.  I don't know her name.  If I didn't do that, I  would tell my daughter and she would sort it out"".  A third person said, ""I would go to head office.  I don't see why they should not take me seriously"".  A relative said, ""I would be able to say if I wasn't happy about  something"".  A staff member added, ""[Named registered manager] has her office, so people can talk to her  anytime"".  The provider had a complaints policy, but no formal complaints had been received since October  2015.  17 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   A range of systems was in place to measure and monitor the quality of the service overall.  However, the  audits in place had not identified the issues we found in relation to the safe management of medicines.   People's care records were not always held confidentially or securely.  Daily logs relating to people's care  were stored in unlocked drawers in a communal area. This room was not locked and was accessed by staff  and people living at the home.  We saw that some notices attached to a wall in this room contained sensitive information about people's individual needs.  Improvements were only made by the registered manager  after the areas of concern had been discussed with them.    The above evidence shows that systems or process were not operated effectively to assess and monitor the  service.  Care records were not kept securely.  This is a breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care  Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  We discussed the issues relating to confidentiality with the registered manager.  By the second day of our  inspection, improvements had been made and personal information relating to people was stored in a  locked facility.  Sensitive information was no longer on display.  The registered manager had introduced some initiatives into the home which had a positive impact on the  care and support people received.  For example, staff had completed a project to encourage people to drink  in sufficient quantities to promote good hydration, a project to reduce the risk of people being admitted to  hospital and a system to promote good communication about people's care needs between staff who  looked after them.  People and their relatives spoke positively about the service provided at Rosedale Care Home.  Residents'  meetings took place and we looked at the minutes for a meeting held in July 2017 which showed items  discussed: residents, menus, laundry, entertainment and activities, environment, staffing and arrangements  for a garden party which was planned in August.  The next residents' meeting was scheduled for October  2017.  People were aware of meetings that took place.  One person said, ""We have meetings once a month""  and another person told us, ""They have meetings, but I choose not to go to them"".  One staff member said  that relatives were invited to residents' meetings, but, ""Relatives don't always want to engage with these.   The manager lives locally and is always on the end of a phone"".  In addition to residents' meetings, a  newsletter was produced to update people and relatives on what was happening at the home.  We were  shown a copy of the newsletter which was circulated in June 2017.  People were asked for their feedback  about the home through residents' surveys and comments were positive.  A friend of one person at the  home told us, ""I helped to choose the home for [named person].   I was overwhelmed, her room is great.  I  walked in and there were all these smiling faces.  It felt really comfortable.  There's something unassuming  about this place.  The manager was brilliant.  [Named person] was very unsure and very nervous initially.   The manager went to collect her and staff have been very patient.  Now she feels safe and she's happy"".  A registered manager was in post.  A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service.  Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered   18 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and  associated Regulations about how the service is run.    We asked people for their views on the way the home was managed.  One person said, ""I think they carry out things very well.  I am extremely lucky.  I don't think people realise how much I appreciate it"".  Another  person told us, ""Everything is very well organised – the staff – different people have different abilities and  some do it better than others"".  Staff felt supported by the registered manager.  One staff member said, ""If  anything was not right, you could go to the manager; she is more of a friend"".  Another staff member said,  ""The manager genuinely cares.  If I have any problems, she will talk things through and is very supportive.   It's a happy staff team and she is the leading light who shines through.  It is like a family.  It's like I leave one  family and go to another"".  A third staff member told us, ""I think this is the best care home and it's really  homely and comfortable.  The manager is really good and cares about everyone.  I like feeling appreciated  and valued"".  People and their relatives felt that the care on offer at Rosedale Care Home was of a high standard.  A  relative said, ""I can't fault it.  It's a great place with brilliant staff.  They just get on and do it.  I have no  concerns at all"".  Another relative told us, ""The staff are wonderful and so is the home"".  Where people had sustained falls, these were analysed and any emerging trends identified.  Daily, weekly  and monthly checks we looked at related to the health and safety of the home, including infection audits.   Call bells were tested regularly and on the first day of our inspection.  Checks in relation to fire safety and  maintenance were all satisfactory.  Staff training was reviewed and cleaning schedules were in place.  A staff  member talked about the 'family atmosphere' of the home and said, ""People always seem happy and it's  clean.  If people want something, they have it"".  The registered manager worked in partnership with other agencies, including the local safeguarding  authority. The registered manager was the chair of the Local Care Association and worked with the Skills for  Care Sussex Networking Group, Dementia Care Pathway (Horsham Dementia Care Alliance) and the Local  Workforce Action Alliance and Mental Capacity Networking Group. This enabled the registered provider to  network with others and share information to inform good practice.  19 Rosedale Care Home Inspection report 14 March 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.

Bramble Cottage Retirement Home is a  care home registered to provide support for older people who require personal care. The service is  registered to support a maximum of 28 people. The service specialises in providing both long and short  stays as well as respite breaks for older people. There were 27 people living at the service on the day of our  inspection. Bramble Cottage Retirement Home was last inspected in October 2014 and no concerns were  identified.  A registered manager was in post. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality  Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered  persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act and  associated Regulations about how the service is run.  People's medicines were stored safely and in line with legal regulations and people received their  medication on time. However, safe procedures for the administration of the medication were not routinely  being followed, which placed people at potential risk of receiving their medicines incorrectly. We have  identified this as an area of practice that needs improvement.  We have made a recommendation about the management of medicines.  People were happy and relaxed with staff. They said they felt safe and there were sufficient staff to support  them. One person told us, ""I feel 100% safe here"". Another said, ""There is always a member of staff nearby"".  When staff were recruited, their employment history was checked and references obtained. Checks were  also undertaken to ensure new staff were safe to work within the care sector. Staff were knowledgeable and  trained in safeguarding adults and what action they should take if they suspected abuse was taking place.  People were being supported to make decisions in their best interests. The registered manager and staff had received training in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) and the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  Accidents and incidents were recorded appropriately and steps taken to minimise the risk of similar events  happening in the future. Risks associated with the environment and equipment had been identified and  managed. Emergency procedures were in place in the event of fire and people knew what to do, as did the  staff.  Staff had received essential training and there were opportunities for additional training specific to the  needs of the service, including caring for people with Parkinson's disease and palliative care (end of life).  Staff had received both one to one and group supervision meetings with their manager, and formal personal development plans, such as annual appraisals were in place. One member of staff told us, ""I get  supervisions, it's useful, but I can speak up on a daily basis"". Another said, ""The training is very good and  always available. We requested Parkinson's training and got it"".  2 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  People were encouraged and supported to eat and drink well. There was a varied daily choice of meals and  people were able to give feedback and have choice in what they ate and drank. One person told us, ""The  food is excellent, very good"". Special dietary requirements were met, and people's weight was monitored,  with their permission. Health care was accessible for people and appointments were made for regular  check-ups as needed.  People chose how to spend their day and they took part in activities in the service and the community.  People told us they enjoyed the activities, which included a popular weekly quiz, gentle exercises, recitals  and themed events with external entertainers. One person told us, ""I join in with whatever is going on. The  quiz in particular is excellent, and we can do crosswords every night"".  People were also encouraged to stay  in touch with their families and receive visitors.  People felt well looked after and supported. We observed friendly and genuine relationships had developed  between people and staff. One person told us, ""The staff are so hard working and conscientious and will  come any time, day or night"". Care plans described people's needs and preferences and they were  encouraged to be as independent as possible.  People were encouraged to express their views and had completed surveys. Feedback received showed  people were satisfied overall, and felt staff were friendly and helpful. People also said they felt listened to  and any concerns or issues they raised were addressed. One person told us, ""I would speak to [registered  manager] if I needed to complain, but it's very unlikely I would need to, as they are too observant of  everything that is happening"".  Staff were asked for their opinions on the service and whether they were happy in their work. They felt  supported within their roles, describing an 'open door' management approach, where managers were  always available to discuss suggestions and address problems or concerns. The provider undertook quality  assurance reviews to measure and monitor the standard of the service and drive improvement.  3 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  Requires Improvement    Good    Good    We always ask the following five questions of services.  "	  The service was not consistently safe.  Medicines were stored appropriately, however, safe procedures  for the administration of the medication were not routinely being followed.   Staff knew how to protect people from abuse and were aware  what to do if they suspected it had taken place.  Staffing numbers were sufficient to ensure people received a safe level of care. Recruitment records demonstrated there were  systems in place to ensure staff were suitable to work within the  care sector.  	  The service was effective.  People spoke highly of members of staff and were supported by  staff who received appropriate training and supervision.  People were supported to maintain their hydration and  nutritional needs. Their health was monitored and staff  responded when health needs changed.  Staff had a firm understanding of the Mental Capacity Act 2005  and the service was meeting the requirements of the Deprivation  of Liberty Safeguards.  	  The service was caring.  People were supported by kind and caring staff.  People were involved in the planning of their care and offered  choices in relation to their care and treatment.  People's privacy and dignity were respected and their  independence was promoted.  4 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  Good    Good    	  The service was responsive.  Care plans accurately recorded people's likes, dislikes and  preferences. Staff had information that enabled them to provide  support in line with people's wishes.  People were supported to take part in meaningful activities. They were supported to maintain relationships with people important  to them.  There was a system in place to manage complaints and  comments. People felt able to make a complaint and were  confident they would be listened to and acted on.  	  The service was well-led.  People, relatives and staff spoke highly of the registered  manager. The provider promoted an inclusive and open culture  and recognised the importance of effective communication.   There were effective systems in place to assure quality and  identify any potential improvements to the service being  provided.  Forums were in place to gain feedback from staff and people.  Feedback was regularly used to drive improvement.  5 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017     Bramble Cottage  Retirement Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  The inspection took place on 8 March 2017. This visit was unannounced, which meant the provider and staff  did not know we were coming. Bramble Cottage Retirement Home was previously inspected in October  2014 and no concerns were identified.  One inspector and an expert by experience in older people's care undertook this inspection. An expert by  experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of  care service. Before our inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service and looked at  notifications which had been submitted. A notification is information about important events which the  provider is required to tell us about by law. The provider had completed a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks the provider to give some key information about the service, what the service does  well and improvements they plan to make.  We observed care in the communal areas and over the three floors of the service. We spoke with people and  staff, and observed how people were supported during their lunch. We spent time observing care and used  the short observational framework for inspection (SOFI), which is a way of observing care to help us  understand the experience of people who could not talk with us. We spent time looking at records, including four people's care records, four staff files and other records relating to the management of the service, such  as policies and procedures, accident/incident recording and audit documentation.  During our inspection, we spoke with nine people living at the service, two care staff, the registered  manager, the deputy manager and the chef. We also 'pathway tracked' people living at the home. This is   6 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  when we followed the care and support a person's receives and obtained their views. It was an important  part of our inspection, as it allowed us to capture information about a sample of people receiving care.  7 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017   	  Requires Improvement  	"   People told us they considered themselves to be safe living at Bramble Cottage Retirement Home, the care  was good and the environment was safe and suitable for their individual needs. One person told us, ""I feel  100% safe here"". Another person said, ""I am never neglected, I only have to ring my bell and they come"".  Everybody we spoke with said that they had no concerns around safety. However, we found areas of  practice that need improvement.  We looked at the management of medicines. Senior care staff were trained in the administration of  medicines. We observed medicines being administered sensitively by the registered manager. They  administered them to people in a discreet and respectful way. However, after giving people their  medication, the registered manager did not stay with the person to ensure that they had taken their  medication safely. The medication for two people was left on a side plate next to them whilst they were  eating their lunch and was accessible to other people sitting at the communal tables. A third person's  medication was given to them to put in a pot to take after their meal. Care home staff should administer  medication to people at the point it should be taken and stay with the person to establish whether the  medication has been taken or refused. This is in order to be able to complete an accurate record of a  person's medication usage. Additionally, through our own observations and feedback from staff, it was  evident that the recording of the medication administered for these people in their individual medication  assessment records (MAR) was completed simultaneously at the end of the medication round, rather than  individually after each specific administration. Care home staff should complete the MAR only when a  person has taken their prescribed medicine, and the individual record should be completed before moving  on to the next person. This is to reduce the risk of MAR's being recorded incorrectly. We raised this with the  registered manager, who was aware that they were not following best practice guidelines, and the correct  procedure for the administration of the medication as set out in the providers own policy and procedural  documentation.  Medicines were stored appropriately and securely and in line with legal requirements. We checked that  medicines were ordered appropriately and medicines which were out of date or no longer needed were  disposed of safely. We also saw that regular auditing of medicine procedures had taken place. We checked  the MAR charts of the six people and saw they were accurate. Nobody we spoke with expressed any  concerns around their medicines. However, the above issues around medication administration and  recording have been identified this as an area of practice that needs improvement.  We recommend the provider should take into account the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE)  guidance on 'Managing Medicines in Care Homes'. Additionally, we recommend the provider should take  into account ongoing learning and development guides in adult social care by Skills for Care.  People were supported to be safe without undue restrictions on their freedom and choices about how they  spent their time. Throughout the inspection, we regularly saw people moving freely around the service. The  registered manager and staff adopted a positive approach to risk taking. Positive risk taking involves looking at measuring and balancing the risk and the positive benefits from taking risks against the negative effects of  8 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  attempting to avoid risk altogether. Risk assessments were in place which considered the identified risks  and the measures required to minimise any harm whilst empowering the person to undertake the activity.  For example, people were assessed to access the community and manage their own medication. The  registered manager told us, ""The ethos is that life is all about a certain amount of risk, people can do what  they please. It's easy to let people make their own choices"".  There were further systems to identify risks and protect people from harm. Risks to people's safety were  assessed and reviewed. Each person's care plan had a number of risk assessments completed which were  specific to their needs, such as mobility, risk of falls and medicines. The assessments outlined the associated hazards and what measures could be taken to reduce or eliminate the risk. We also saw safe care practices  taking place, such as staff supporting people to mobilise around the service.  Staff had a good understanding of what to do if they suspected people were at risk of abuse or harm, or if  they had any concerns about the care or treatment that people received in the home. They had a clear  understanding of who to contact to report any safety concerns and all staff had received up to date  safeguarding training. They told us this helped them to understand the importance of reporting if people  were at risk, and they understood their responsibility for reporting concerns if they needed to do so. There  was information displayed in the home so that people, visitors and staff would know who to contact to raise  any concerns if they needed to. There were clear policies and procedures available for staff to refer to if  needed.   Staffing levels were assessed daily, or when the needs of people changed, to ensure people's safety. The  registered manager told us, ""We have consistent staff who live locally. We've always had sufficient numbers.  We've put on extra staff for example if somebody was receiving palliative care and wanted somebody to stay with them through the night"". We were told that existing staff would be contacted to cover shifts in  circumstances such as sickness and annual leave. Feedback from people and staff indicated they felt the  service had enough staff and our own observations supported this. One person told us, ""There is always a  member of staff nearby"". A member of staff added, ""This is the only home I know that is comfortable with  staffing numbers"". Another member of staff added, ""There are enough staff here. If there were any more,  there would be people hanging around"".  Staff had been recruited through an effective recruitment process that ensured they were safe to work with  people. Appropriate checks had been completed prior to staff starting work which included checks through  the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). These checks identify if prospective staff had a criminal record or  were barred from working with children or vulnerable people. The service had obtained employment  references and employment histories. We saw evidence that staff had been interviewed following the  submission of a completed application form.  Risks associated with the safety of the environment and equipment were identified and managed  appropriately. Regular fire alarm tests took place along with water temperature tests and regular fire drills  were taking place to ensure that people and staff knew what action to take in the event of a fire. Gas,  electrical, legionella and fire safety certificates were in place and renewed as required to ensure the  premises remained safe. There was a business continuity plan. This instructed staff on what to do in the  event of the service not being able to function normally, such as a loss of power or evacuation of the  property. People's ability to evacuate the building in the event of a fire had been considered and where  required each person had an individual personal evacuation plan. Generic and individual health and safety  risk assessments were in place to make sure staff worked in as safe a way as possible.  9 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us they received effective care and their individual needs were met. One person told us, ""The  staff are marvellous"". Another person said, ""The staff are competent and I feel that everyone knows their  jobs and does them well"". Another person added, ""The food is excellent, very good"".  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best  interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and  hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA. Staff had knowledge of the  principles of the MCA and gave us examples of how they would follow appropriate procedures in practice.  Staff told us they explained the person's care to them and gained consent before carrying out care.  Throughout the inspection, we saw staff speaking clearly and gently and waiting for responses. A member of staff told added, ""We're very up to date with the MCA"". Members of staff recognised that people had the right to refuse consent. The registered manager and staff understood the principles of DoLS and how to keep  people safe from being restricted unlawfully. They also knew how to make an application for consideration  to deprive a person of their liberty, and we saw appropriate paperwork that supported this.  Staff told us the training they received was thorough and they felt they had the skills they needed to carry  out their roles effectively. Training schedules confirmed staff received essential training on areas such as,  moving and handling, medication and infection control. Staff had also received training that was specific to  the needs of the people living at the service, this included caring for people with Parkinson's disease and  palliative care (end of life). Staff spoke highly of the opportunities for training. One member of staff told us,  ""The training is very good and we are always offered further training"". Another member of staff added, ""The  training is very good and always available. We requested Parkinson's training and got it"".  The provider operated an effective induction programme which allowed new members of staff to be  introduced to the running of Bramble Cottage Retirement Home and the people living at the service. Staff  told us they had received a good induction which equipped them to work with people. One member of staff  told us, ""The induction was very useful. I'd worked in care before, but no two homes are the same"". The  registered manager added, ""The induction includes training, walk rounds and shadow shifts. New staff are  put on the Care Certificate"". The Care Certificate is an identified set of standards that health and social care  workers adhere to in their daily working life.  There was an on-going programme of supervision. Supervision is a formal meeting where training needs,  objectives and progress for the year are discussed. Members of staff commented they found the forum of  supervision useful and felt able to approach the registered manager with any concerns or queries. One   10 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  member of staff told us, ""I get supervisions, it's useful, but I can speak up on a daily basis"". Another member  of staff added, ""I get regular supervision, it's all ok"".  People commented that their healthcare needs were effectively managed and met. They felt confident in  the skills of the staff meeting their healthcare needs. One person told us how they had recently required a  trip to hospital, they said, ""The staff dealt with it very calmly, they were amazing. They all knew what to do  and didn't panic"". Staff were committed to providing high quality, effective care. One member of staff told  us, ""One person had not been well, I saw their deterioration and raised it with the deputy manager"". Where  required, people were supported to access routine medical support, for example, from an optician to check  their eyesight. In addition, people had input into their care from healthcare professionals such as doctors  and chiropodists whenever necessary. The registered manager added, ""Staff would come to me with any  concerns, no matter how small. We offer an escort service to take people to appointments"".  People were complimentary about the food and drink. One person told us, ""The food is tasty and of a good  standard"". Another person said, ""The food is adequate and there is lots of it"". People were involved in  making their own decisions about the food they ate. Special diets were catered for, such as gluten free and  culturally appropriate meals. For breakfast, lunch and supper, people were provided with options of what  they would like to eat. The chef confirmed that alternative choices of meal were always available, and there  were no restrictions on the amount or type of food people could order.  We observed lunch in the dining area. It was relaxed and people were considerately supported to move to  the dining areas, or could choose to eat in their room. Tables were set with place mats, napkins and glasses.  The cutlery and crockery were of a good standard, and condiments were available. The food was presented  in an appetising manner and people spoke highly of the lunchtime meal. The atmosphere was enjoyable  and relaxing for people. People were encouraged to be independent throughout the meal and staff were  available if people wanted support, extra food or additional choices. Staff understood the importance of  monitoring people's food and drink intake and monitored for any signs of dehydration or weight loss.  People's weights were recorded monthly, with permission by the individual. Where people had lost weight,  we saw that advice was sought from the GP.  11 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017   "	  Good  	"   People were supported with kindness and compassion. They told us caring relationships had developed  with staff who supported them. Everyone we spoke with thought they were well cared for and treated with  respect and dignity, and had their independence promoted. One person told us, ""The staff are so hard  working and conscientious and will come any time, day or night"". Another person said, ""They [staff] are so  kind"". A further person added, ""Nothing is too much trouble, they look after me very well indeed"".  Positive relationships had developed with people. One person told us, ""The staff are charming"". Another  person said of their regular care workers, ""They are like best friends to me"". Staff showed kindness when  speaking with them. Staff took their time to talk with people and showed them that they were important.  Staff always approached people face on and at eye level, they demonstrated empathy and compassion for  the people they supported. Friendly conversations were taking place. Staff demonstrated a strong  commitment to providing compassionate care. From talking to staff, they each had a firm understanding of  how best to provide support. The registered manager told us that staff ensured that they read people's care  plans in order to know more about them. We spoke with staff who confirmed this was the case and gave us  examples of people's individual personalities and character traits.  Bramble Cottage Retirement Home had a calm and homely feel. Throughout the inspection, people were  observed freely moving around the service and spending time in the communal areas. People's rooms were  personalised with their belongings and memorabilia. People were supported to maintain their personal and  physical appearance, and were dressed in the clothes they preferred and in the way they wanted.  The registered manager and staff recognised that dignity in care also involved providing people with choice  and control. Throughout the inspection, we observed people being given a variety of choices of what they  would like to do and where they would like to spend time. People were empowered to make their own  decisions. They told us they that they were free to do very much what they wanted throughout the day. They  said they could choose what time they got up, when they went to bed, how and where to spend their day,  what they wanted to wear and how their care was delivered. One person told us, ""They [staff] listen to you  and always ask me if I'm ok and do I want anything"". Staff were committed to ensuring people remained in  control and received support that centred on them as an individual. One member of staff told us, ""Nothing is set in stone, nothing is regimented, you can have a cup of tea when you want. If you want to have breakfast  and go back to bed, that's fine, it's about what they want"". Another member of staff said, ""It's automatic to  offer choice, It's about constantly asking questions"" The registered manager said, ""People's choices are  recorded in care plans, what time you would like breakfast, how early you would like a cup of tea and  choices around how people spend their day"".  There were arrangements in place to protect and uphold people's confidentiality, privacy and dignity.  Members of staff had a firm understanding of the principles of privacy and dignity. As part of staff's  induction, privacy and dignity was covered and the registered manager undertook competency checks to  ensure staff were adhering to these principles. They were able to describe how they worked in a way that  protected people's privacy and dignity. One member of staff told us, ""We always knock on doors, even if it's   12 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  with our elbows because we're carrying a tray"". People confirmed this, and we saw doors were closed and  staff knocking before entering anybody's room. One person told us, ""The staff are very polite and pleasant"".  Care records were stored securely. Confidential information was kept secure and there were policies and  procedures to protect people's confidentiality. Staff had a good understanding of privacy and confidentiality and had received training pertaining to this.  Staff supported people and encouraged them, where they were able, to be as independent as possible. One  member of staff told us, ""We always encourage people, for example to have bath. It's all about promoting  what they can do"". Another member of staff said, ""I'm always asking, do you want help, or shall we do it? It  definitely helps their independence"". The registered manager added, ""Staff know to encourage  independence. It may take longer, but it's important to improve skills and better health"".  People were able to maintain relationships with those who mattered to them. Visiting was not restricted and guests were welcome at any time. People could see their visitors in the communal areas or in their own  room. The registered manager told us, ""People can visit at any time and visitors can have lunch with us"".  13 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017   "	  Good  	"   People told us they were listened to and the service responded to their needs and concerns. People had  access to a range of activities and could choose what they wanted to do. One person told us ""They always  ask me if I'm happy and I reply that I couldn't be happier"". Another person said, ""I would speak to [registered manager] if I needed to complain, but it's very unlikely I would need to, as they are too observant of  everything that is happening"". A further person added, ""The activities make a nice break"".  There was regular involvement in activities. Activities on offer included a popular weekly quiz, gentle  exercises, recitals and themed events with external entertainers. One person told us, ""I join in with whatever  is going on. The quiz in particular is excellent, and we can do crosswords every night"". Meetings with  residents were held to gather peoples' ideas, personal choices and preferences on how to spend their  leisure time. On the day of the inspection, we saw activities taking place for people. We saw people being  entertained by a visiting singer. People were clearly enjoying the activity and it engaged several other people in the room. Feedback from people who attended the activities was gathered, which enabled staff to  provide activities that were meaningful and relevant to people. The service also supported people to  maintain their hobbies and interests, for example one person had an interest in sports and planned their  day around sporting events on a specific television station that had been installed for them to watch.  Another person enjoyed accessing an exercise class and others had an interest in painting that was catered  for. The service also published a newsletter called the 'Bramble Ramble' that contained details of local  events, such as football reports and additionally informed people of when certain activities would be taking  place.  We saw that people's needs were assessed and plans of care were developed to meet those needs, in a  structured and consistent manner. Paperwork confirmed people or their relatives were involved in the  formation of the initial care plans and were subsequently asked if they would like to be involved in any care  plan reviews. Care plans contained personal information, which recorded details about people and their  lives. Staff told us they knew people well and had a good understanding of their family history, individual  personality, interests and preferences, which enabled them to engage effectively and provide meaningful,  person centred care.  Each section of the care plan was relevant to the person and their needs. Areas covered included; mobility,  nutrition and personal care. Information was also clearly documented regarding people's healthcare needs  and the support required meeting those needs. Care plans contained detailed information on the person's  likes, dislikes and daily routine with clear guidance for staff on how best to support that individual. For  example, one care plan stated that they did not want to eat green vegetables or complete a personal life  history. Another care plan stated that a person preferred a male care worker when having a bath.  The registered manager told us that staff ensured that they read peoples care plans in order to know more  about them. We spoke with staff who confirmed this and gave us examples of people's individual  personalities and character traits that were reflected in peoples care plans. One member of staff told us, ""I  took the time to read the care plans. If they were missing any information, we'd say"". Another said, ""The care  14 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  plans are fine, you get to know people. I can tell you everything about what people like and dislike"".  There were systems and processes in place to consult with people, relatives, staff and healthcare  professionals. Satisfaction surveys were carried out, providing the registered manager with a mechanism for  monitoring people's satisfaction with the service provided. Feedback from the surveys was on the whole  positive, and changes were made in light of peoples' suggestions.  People and relatives were aware of how to make a complaint and all felt they would have no problem  raising any issues. One person told us, ""Oh yes [the complaints procedure] it's printed in the handbook, but I can't imagine ever needing to complain"". The complaints procedure and policy were accessible and  displayed around the service. Most people we spoke with told us they had not needed to complain and that  any minor issues were dealt with informally.  15 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017   "	  Good  	"   People and staff all told us that they were satisfied with the service provided at the home and the way it was  managed. Staff commented they felt supported and could approach the registered manager with any  concerns or questions. One person told us, ""She [registered manager] is excellent. Wonderful and very  competent"". Another person said, ""[The registered manager] is very well organised and always has the time  to listen"". A further person added, ""Everything is naturally open and it doesn't need to be formal"".  We discussed the culture and ethos of the service with the registered manager and staff. The registered  manager told us, ""This is a homely home where people can have as many choices as they like. We provide  everything we can that they would have in their own home. We have a good staff team, we are very good.  They never cut corners and have good standards of work. They have been here a long time, but their  standards stay the same, as mine do. You can't be complacent"". One person supported this and told us,  ""You wouldn't get a better place than this"". A member of staff added, ""There should be more homes like this. I'd put my relatives here and come here myself. It's the resident's home, if they are happy then we are  happy"". In respect to staff, the registered manager added, ""We have a stable management group. I'm fair  and flexible and staff won't wait, they'll come and talk to me. They are well supported"". Staff said they felt  well supported within their roles and described an 'open door' management approach. One member of staff said, ""I can approach [registered manager] at any time"". Another said, ""[The registered manager] always  listens to us and has always got our backs. She will help out on the floor, it's comfy here"".  People were actively involved in developing the service. We were told that people gave feedback about staff  and the service. We saw that people had been involved in choosing specific foods for the weekly menu, such  as having croissants for breakfast, and also in including details of the daily activities in the in-house  newsletter. Staff were encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions about how the service is run and  address problems or concerns with management. We were given an example whereby through feedback  from staff, changes had been made to the size of documents used to record care procedures, in order to be  able to record more information. The registered manager told us, ""We are always looking for feedback. We  ask staff all the time for ideas about improvements. They are not frightened of giving ideas"". A member of  staff said, ""We get regular meetings and we all communicate. This is the best place I've ever worked"". Staff  were aware of the whistle blowing policy and when to take concerns to appropriate agencies outside of the  service if they felt they were not being dealt with effectively. We saw that policies, procedures and contact  details were available for staff to do this.  Management was visible within the service and the registered manager worked alongside staff which gave  them insight into their role and the challenges they faced. The registered manager told us, ""We have good  lines of communication. I'm completely happy for staff to involve me in their decision making"". The service  had a strong emphasis on team work and communication sharing. There were open and transparent  methods of communication within the home. Staff attended daily handovers. This kept them informed of  any developments or changes to people's needs. One member of staff told us, ""The handover meeting is a  good time to find out what I need to know for my shift"". Another member of staff said, ""We are definitely a  good team and it's all about the communication"". Staff commented that they all worked together and   16 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  approached concerns as a team. One member of staff said, ""If anything comes up we all help each other"".  The provider undertook quality assurance audits to ensure a good level of quality was maintained. We saw  audit activity which included medication, care planning and infection control. The results of which were  analysed in order to determine trends and introduce preventative measures. The information gathered from regular audits, monitoring and feedback was used to recognise any shortfalls and make plans accordingly to drive up the quality of the care delivered. Accidents and incidents were reported, monitored and patterns  were analysed, so appropriate measures could be put in place when needed. Mechanisms were in place for  the registered manager to keep up to date with changes in policy, legislation and best practice. The  registered manager was supported by the provider and up to date sector specific information was also  made available for staff.  Services that provide health and social care to people are required to inform the Care Quality Commission,  (the CQC), of important events that happen in the service. The manager had informed the CQC of significant  events in a timely way. This meant we could check that appropriate action had been taken. The manager  was also aware of their responsibilities under the Duty of Candour. The Duty of Candour is a regulation that  all providers must adhere to. Under the Duty of Candour, providers must be open and transparent and it  sets out specific guidelines providers must follow if things go wrong with care and treatment.  17 Bramble Cottage Retirement Home Inspection report 10 April 2017  "

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in September 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 12 February 2018 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two inspectors and two experts by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The experts by experience had  experience of older people's care.   During the inspection we spoke with eight people who used the service, one relative and two visitors. We  also spoke with the registered manager, deputy manager, a senior care worker, five care workers, the cook,  the activities co-ordinator and a domestic assistant. We observed care and support, including the mealtime  experience and looked around the home. We looked at five people's care records and other records such as  medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training records and maintenance  records. Following the inspection we telephoned two relatives to ask them for their views on the service.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health professional who works with the  service.   We used information the provider sent us in the Provider Information Return. This is information we require  providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the service   6 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  does well and improvements they plan to make.  7 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service safe?  Good  Our findings   People told us they felt safe living at Summerfield Residential Home. One person said ""Yes I am safe here, I  do feel safe at present."" Another person said ""If I didn't feel safe I wouldn't be here. A third person said ""Yes, I  feel safe more or less as much as you can feel safe. I don't get knocked about or anything like that here."" A  relative told us, ""Mum is safe here, I don't worry when I leave.""   Staff had completed safeguarding training and said they would not hesitate to report concerns to a senior  member of staff, the registered manager, the safeguarding team or CQC. We saw appropriate liaison and  referral to the local adult protection unit had been made following the identification of safeguarding  concerns. Measures were put in place following any safeguarding incidents to protect people, this included  safeguarding care plans where people were identified as being at risk. This helped keep people safe.   Risks to people's health and safety were assessed and mitigated against. This included the risks associated  with poor skin integrity, poor nutrition, moving and handling and behaviours that challenge. Risk  assessments were updated regularly and plans of care provided instructions on how to keep people safe.  Equipment such as air flow mattresses and bed rails were put in place following liaison with healthcare  professionals to help keep people safe. The service had recently made improvements to moving and  handling practices and had purchased new slings to ensure each person who required hoisting had their  own individualised sling. We observed people who had problems with their mobility being supported by  care staff. We saw one person being aided to move with assistance from a hoist into a wheelchair. Staff  explained to the person what they were doing whilst assisting them. We observed that the footplates on the  wheelchair were used. Our observations showed that staff assisted this person to move in a safe way.     Positive risks were undertaken to support people to maintain their freedom and achieve their goals. One  person had complex medical and mobility needs, but expressed a desire to go on a steam train. The service  had thought carefully about how this could be done safely and devised a positive risk assessment to allow  the person to go. Staff had reviewed the trip afterwards and recorded a positive outcome for the person.  Staff had concluded ""Just because there are risks and obstacles doesn't meant that trips out for people with medical and mobility concerns are impossible.""  This showed a good approach to ensuring risks did not  restrict people's freedom and ability to achieve their goals.   The premises was safely managed and suitable for its intended purpose. Checks were undertaken on the  gas, electrical and fire systems as well as equipment such as hoists to ensure they remained safe.   Temperature checks were undertaken on hot water systems to ensure they remained within safe limits,  although some outlets had not been tested for several months.  We checked some taps and found the water  temperatures to be safe.   Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEP) were in place for each person showing how to evacuate them  in a fire. These were stored electronically and also in a folder so they could be accessed quickly in the event  of an emergency. A fire risk assessment had been carried out by a competent person and the registered  manager had made fire safety improvements as per their recommendations.  8 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded there were sufficient quantities to staff to ensure prompt and safe care. Overall, people told  us they thought there were sufficient numbers of staff at the home. One person said, ""Oh yes, I feel very safe  in this place, because there is always staff about."" Another person said, ""I feel safe at night as there are three  staff on at night. If I press that button on that wall, they would come immediately."" A third person said,  ""There are enough carers here."" Staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on each shift to ensure  people's needs were met. The registered manager told us staffing levels could be increased if people's needs changed and this was confirmed by staff.   Rotas' showed the required staffing levels were consistently maintained. The registered manager or deputy  were on call should they be needed out of hours in an emergency. The registered manager did not use  agency staff. When there were shifts to be covered existing staff picked these up so people were provided  with consistent care from familiar staff. The care team were supported by housekeepers, cooks, laundry staff and an activities co-ordinator. We saw there was a good staff presence around the home and heard call bells were answered in a timely way. We concluded there were enough staff to care for people safely and to keep  the home clean.  We reviewed three staff files and found safe recruitment procedures were in place to ensure new staff were  of suitable character to work with vulnerable people. New staff were required to complete an application  form and attend an interview. Disclosure and Baring Service (DBS) checks and references were then taken  up.  Any issues raised had been thoroughly risk assessed by the registered manager to ensure staff were safe  to work at the service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us they got  their medicines consistently and on time. One person said, ""I am a diabetic. They [staff] have to do my  bloods every day. They [staff] manage my diabetes better than the nurses did when I was in hospital. Senior  staff give me my medication, which I always get on time."" Medication care plans were in place which gave  information, for example of any allergies and how people preferred to take their medicines. This  demonstrated each person had a personalised plan to support them to take their medicines safely.   We saw medicines were stored in locked trolleys, cabinets or fridges, all of which were clean and tidy. Senior  staff took responsibility for administering medicines and we saw them doing this with patience and  kindness. We spoke with a senior care worker who confirmed they had received training and the deputy  manager told us they observed staff administering medicines as part of their medicines audit. We looked at  a sample of medication administration records (MARs) and saw people were being given medicines as  prescribed. We checked a random sample of medicines and found the stocks being held were accurate. This  showed us medicines were being managed safely.  The home was also clean and free from odours in all of the communal areas. People living at the service  confirmed that the home was always kept clean and odour free. One person told us, ""The home is clean –  the bathroom, everywhere is kept spotless. It is always nice and warm here.""Another person said, ""The  cleaner here is one of the best I have ever seen."" A third person said, ""This is a nice, warm house – very clean  – we have cleaners in every day.""  Cleaning staff were in place and they said they had the resources and time  to keep the home clean. We saw staff adhering to good infection control techniques and checks were  regularly undertaken on infection control and cleaning practices.  We saw systems were in place to ensure  items were laundered promptly although due to space limitations in the laundry room, there was not a clear separation of clean and dirty laundry.   Incidents and accidents were recorded and action taken to reduce the likelihood of a re-occurrence.  Following each incident a management report was completed detailing the suspected cause and any action  9 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  needed.  Incidents were analysed each month to look for any themes and trends and to check that  appropriate action had been taken to prevent a re-occurrence. We saw following incidents such as falls,  liaison took place with district nurses and risk assessments were updated to help reduce the risk of repeat  incidents.  10 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service effective?  Good  Our findings   Care records demonstrated people's needs were assessed and people told us care was delivered in line with their wishes. The service subscribed to a number of publications to keep up-to-date with best practice  guidance.  The registered manager attended provider forums run by the local authority, which also helped  them keep up-to-date with best practice. They demonstrated to us they improved practice based on  research and guidance.  For example the registered manager had read a study with showed that people  living with dementia benefit from at least an hour of individualised interaction and activity per week. This  had led to them reiterating the importance of personated interaction with the staff team, arranging for staff  to spend more time with each resident.  They told us they had already seen positive outcomes in terms of  people's mood and behaviour and hoped to formally record their findings over the coming months.   We concluded staff had the right skills, knowledge and experience to care for people.  One relative said of  staff ,""Very good staff, all switched on."" Staff were knowledgeable about people and how to meet their  needs. Staff received a range of training relevant to their role. The training matrix showed staff were up to  date with training, or refresher training had been booked. Training courses included infection control,  medicines, first aid, food hygiene, continence care, care planning, moving and handling, palliative care and  safeguarding. We saw staff had also received specialist training in topics such as how to use food  supplements, diabetes and dementia care.  The registered manager told us new staff completed induction training and were enrolled on the Care  Certificate. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip social care and health workers with  the knowledge and skills they need to provide safe, compassionate care. We saw evidence of induction in  the staff files we reviewed. We spoke with one member of care staff who had been recruited recently. They  told us their induction had been comprehensive and had included a period of shadowing which they said  had helped them get to know people who used the service.   Staff were provided with supervision sessions which gave them the opportunity to discuss their work role,  any issues and their professional development. Staff also had an annual appraisal. Staff we spoke with told  us they felt supported and said they could go to the registered manager or deputy manager at any time for  advice or support.  People were supported to maintain a good balanced diet.  People spoke positively about the choice and  quality of food available.  Comments included, ""I have no complaints about the food. You can have what you want. I think you can have a cooked breakfast – not that I have one – but the gentleman opposite me has  bacon."" ""It's not so bad. I usually have porridge and toast. I could have a cooked breakfast if I wanted one.  Some people have bacon and eggs."" ""The food is good here. We all like good food."" ""The food is very good.  We have a choice – they will give you whatever you want for breakfast. If you wanted a cooked breakfast you  can have one. I have my meals in the dining room but you can have your meals in your room.""  Menu's showed sufficient choice and variation of food. There was a four week cycle of menus in operation  and the registered manager explained adjustments to these could be made to incorporate people's   11 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  preferences. The cook also catered for any special diet's such as diabetic and soft meals. Care staff made the cook aware if people were losing weight and meals and drinks were fortified accordingly. Jugs of nutritional  supplements and fortified milk were made up in the mornings so they were available when needed.   During  the morning we saw people being asked if they wanted drinks as we saw a drinks trolley being taken around  the home. We also observed jugs of both blackcurrant and orange juices, in the lounges as well as snacks.  Mid-morning drinks and snacks were on offer and mid-afternoon drinks and cake were served to provide  people with additional nutrition.   We observed lunchtime in the dining room and found it to be a positive experience. All the tables had been  set with cutlery and condiments. There were flowers and serviettes on each table.  We observed one person  who needed some support with their meal. Staff were supportive yet unobtrusive. People were also offered  clothes protectors before commencing to eat their meal.  We saw that people were given choices as to  where they wished to eat their lunch.  Some people had their lunch in their own rooms.   We looked at the care records for one person who had been assessed as being nutritionally at risk and saw  their weight was being monitored closely. We saw staff, patiently sitting with them, offering them  encouragement to eat and drink.  People had nutritional risk assessments and care plans in place which  were regularly updated. This provided us with assurance people's nutritional needs were being met.   The service worked with other organisations and health professionals to help ensure effective care and  treatment. People we spoke with confirmed they had access to health care services and reported no  concerns in this area.  One person said ""The district nurse come in regularly she is coming in today to see to  my leg."" Another person said, ""If I became unwell –they [staff] would get the doctor out."" A third person said,  ""If I became unwell they [staff] would get the doctor out straight away. If someone was admitted to hospital,  a summary care plan was sent with them so the hospital had information on their care and support needs.   We saw feedback had been received from the hospital praising the quality of the care plans which  accompanied people as well as the knowledge of the care home staff that had supported them.  This helped ensure people received good joined up care when moving between services.   The 'Tele medicines system' was in use at the service. This was a free system for care homes provided by the  NHS and run exclusively from Airedale Hospital. The NHS provided the home with a laptop and camera to  run the system, when this was set up the care home could get straight through to the Nurses Hub at Airedale Hospital for advice. This was a fully portable system and could be taken to peoples bedrooms where they  could speak directly to a nurse.  If there were visible symptoms the camera could focus on these and it  would show up on the screen for the medics to assess and give advice. It could also be used to get advice on medicines. If someone required hospital treatment 'Tele medicines' staff could fast track the admission.    Care records assessed people's health conditions and put plans of care in place for staff to follow.  In the  care records we looked at we saw people had been seen by a range of health care professionals, including  GPs, opticians, dentists and podiatrists.  Staff told us if there were any concerns about people's health the  senior members of staff acted promptly either by using the 'Telemedicines' system or by contacting a GP. A  senior care worker said if anyone was a bit out of character they would routinely get a urine sample to rule  out any underlying infection. We concluded people's health care needs were being met.  The premises were of high quality, appropriately designed and adapted to meet people's individual needs.   People's bedrooms were a reasonable size and overlooked the garden of the property. We saw that people  had their own television/radio as some told us they chose to spend a lot of time in their own room. They told us they did this because they preferred the quietness of their own bedroom. Some people had photographs  of members of their family around them on their bedside tables. One person had brought their own cat into   12 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  the home. They told us how much comfort this brought them. The person said, ""They [staff] even let me  bring my cat into the home, which was brilliant.""  We saw that communal areas were nicely furnished and decorated. The furnishings were of a good  standard. Communal areas were well lit. We saw that there were no light bulbs either missing or not  working, which meant that staff worked hard to maintain good lighting to promote a homely atmosphere  and help reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that bedrooms were always re- decorated before people moved into them to ensure a high quality living environment. We saw there was a  person centred approach to this. For example two male residents had agreed to move into a room together,  a large room had been chosen to safely accommodate the moving and handling equipment they required.  The room was being decorated and furnished to their preferences with a large flat-screen television being  placed on the wall.  This demonstrated a person centred approach.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The service was acting within the  Mental Capacity Act. People's capacity to consent to their care and support arrangements was assessed.  Where people lacked capacity and it had been assessed that the accumulation of restrictions amounted to a deprivation of liberty, appropriate DoLS applications had been made. There was one current authorised  DoLS in place with other applications awaiting assessment by the local authority. The authorised DoLS had  one condition attached to it which had been met by the service.    People were asked consent before care and support was provided. Where people lacked capacity best  interest decisions had been made involving families and staff from the service. We saw clear best interest  processes had been followed, for example, for people who were moving bedrooms.  The registered manager had a list of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) which were in place. A LPA is a legal  document that allows someone to make decisions for you, or act on your behalf, if you're no longer able to  or if you no longer want to make your own decisions. LPA's can be put in place for property and financial  affairs or health and welfare. This showed us the registered manager understood their responsibilities to act  within the legislation.  13 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service caring?  Good  Our findings   At the last two inspections we found a lack of person centred approach regarding some people's mealtime  regimes. We found there was not always an appropriate gap between breakfast and lunchtime, which  demonstrated a lack of person centred approach to care and support. At this inspection we found  improvements had been made. More thought had gone into planning mealtimes to meet people's individual needs.  People could eat at a time that suited them, and we saw appropriate gaps between meals for those  who needed assistance.   Everyone told us they were well looked after by staff. Comments included: ""They [staff] are all very good and  nice. The staff do treat me well, but I do think they work hard."" They [staff] are not so bad – they are easy to  get on with."" ""They [staff] are human – very friendly.""  ""The staff are very good here. I am very pleased with  the staff – they do their very best and are very helpful."" The staff are wonderful. They [staff] are brilliant and  all of them are very obliging."" A relative told us, ""It's fantastic here and Mum is so happy.""  We spoke with two visitors, who had turned up unannounced to see if the service would be suitable for their relative. They told  us they had been shown around everywhere and thought it was a warm, welcoming, friendly home with  plenty going on.    We observed care. People looked relaxed and comfortable around staff. There was a calm, friendly  atmosphere and we saw staff took time to sit and chat with people. We heard some good humoured banter  shared between people who used the service and staff which resulted in much laughter.  Staff took the time  to talk to people in between care and support tasks. This provided good companionship to people and  made for a lovely atmosphere.   Staff knew people well, for example, we asked them about one person whose care plan we had looked at.  They told us the person liked Opera music and fashion and always liked to be colour co-ordinated. We saw  this person looked well dressed and the entry in the daily records read, ""[Name] looks very smart this  morning with a pale yellow cardigan on, she chose her own clothes."" Person centred information on  people's likes, dislikes and history was maintained in care records which demonstrated staff had sought to  know about people to help provide individualised care and support.   Care staff were very considerate towards people, for example, at breakfast time one person complained  their coffee was 'horrible.' A care worker made them another drink and checked that one was alright before  continuing with their other duties. Another member of staff was sitting with three people in one of the  lounges and discussing with them what they might like to watch on TV. The final decision was a wildlife  programme.  People were able to express their views and were involved in making decisions about their care and support. During the inspection we saw staff asking people where they wanted to sit, what they wanted to eat and do.  Staff patiently waited for people to respond before taking action to meet their requests. Staff meeting  minutes showed that staff were constantly reminded of the importance of offering people choices, even if  they knew people's preferences well.  People had chosen décor, food and activities in the home.  This   14 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  demonstrated the service recognised the importance of listening and acting on people's views. People  confirmed they were able to make choices. For example they said they were able to get up and go to bed at  the times they wanted. One person said ""Yes, you can please yourself as to when you go to bed. I was very  tired yesterday- so I went to bed at 5:45pm – I know it was early but I was exhausted after so many visitors.""  Care plans showed that people and relatives had been consulted over care and support needs. Relatives  told us they felt involved in care and support decisions. We saw they were regularly contacted should  people's care needs changed. Relatives described communication as good.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the registered manager, staff,  people and visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service.  People were consistently treated with dignity and respect by staff.  We saw staff lower their voices to discuss  care and support tasks with people to maintain their confidentiality. Staff knocked on bedroom doors  before entering and ensured doors were closed during the provision of personal care.  If people's relatives  couldn't assist, the service supported people to attend hospital and other medical appointments.  This  helped reduce distress to people. This service was provided free of charge which demonstrated a caring  service.   We asked people about visiting times at the home. People told us their relatives and friends could visit at  any time and that they were unaware of any restrictions. One person said, ""Yes. I do get visitors. They can  visit at any time. There are no restrictions."" Another person said, ""Yes, my neighbours visit every week. There  are no restrictions as to when they visit.""  15 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service responsive?  Good  Our findings   People told us there was a personalised approach to care and support. For example people said they could  follow their preferred daily regimes. They said care was appropriate and met their individual needs.  A  relative said there had been an ""amazing transformation"" in their relatives' condition since they moved to  the home and their care needs were consistently met.  Another relative said, ""They do look after people  really really well"".   Electronic care records were maintained which showed people's needs had been assessed in a range of  areas including nutrition, mobility, social activities and personal care. Regular entries of the care provided  were inputted by care staff. We looked at these which demonstrated people had received the required care  and support interventions. Care and support plans were regularly updated and reviewed when people's  needs changed. This helped ensure responsive care.   The registered manager and deputy manager had attended an information session held by Bradford Council relating to the Accessible Information Standards. They understood their responsibilities in relation to this.  People's care plans gave clear information to staff about people's individual communication needs. For  example one person was partially sighted and there were clear instructions recorded on how to meet their  needs.  We saw staff adapting the way they communicated with people dependant on their individual  communication abilities.   People had access to a wide range of activities which were positively received by people. Comments  included: ""We have a bit of dancing, exercise with a ball."" ""You can go out for a walk if you want to."" ""We  have an entertainments girls who is always organising things. Mondays – we have music – we have a lady  who comes and plays the harp. Next month we have some Alpacas vising the home. We are going out to  Embsay railway. We have been to Scarborough, Bolton Abbey and the Carlisle railway. I like spending a lot of time in my own room – as I like to watch television. I also like sitting outside – when it's good weather."" On  the day of the inspection, people were celebrating one person's birthday in the main lounge near to the  office, during our visit. People were enjoying music, singing, drinks and birthday cake.  An activities co-ordinator was employed who worked four days a week. The programme of activities was on  display in the dining room, which included arts and crafts, light exercises, film afternoon and trips out. There  were also outside entertainers who came into the home. For example, every Monday evening there was a  sing- a-long with The Music Man, Golden Oldies on the first Thursday of every month and Healing Music. On  Friday mornings people could go out to visit Silsden Methodist Church. The activities co-ordinator also  arranged trips out using a local wheelchair accessible Taxi service. These trips included Garden Centres and  Bolton Abbey.   The service undertook one to one activities with some people so they did not become  socially isolated. We saw examples where staff had played music through a tablet computer to people  individually resulting in positive outcomes.  Links to a local Primary School had been developed with the children coming into the home at Christmas to  sing. Arrangements had since been made for four or five children to visit the home every other Thursday to   16 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  read to the people who lived there. There were photographs on display of various events and people's art  work was on display. We concluded people were being provided with a range of activities and social  opportunities to keep them occupied and meet their individual and diverse needs.   People we spoke with knew who to speak to if they had a complaint or any concerns. They all said they  would go the manager. People said they were satisfied with the service and had no complaints. The  complaints procedure was on display and care plans contained information about the support people may  need in order to make a complaint. One relative told us they would feel able to raise any concerns with the  registered manager or deputy manager. We looked at the complaints log and saw any complaints which had been made had been fully investigated and an outcome had been reached in each case. This showed us  concerns were taken seriously and dealt with appropriately. A significant number of compliments had been  received about the service and these were recorded so the service knew the areas in which it exceeded  expectations. For example one said, 'Thank you all so much for looking after my mum and for all your  kindness.' Another said, 'We would like to say all your staff are wonderful , caring and respectful, we cannot  thank you enough.'  Care planning demonstrated the service spoke to people and their relatives to help establish their end of life  needs and wishes.  We saw examples where this had resulted in care plans being produced to guide staff on  the care required.   17 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   Is the service well-led?  Good  Our findings   People and relatives told us they were highly satisfied with the service. No-one we spoke with raised any  concerns with us during our visit. One person said, ""Overall, I am happy with everything. The staff treat me  well.""  Another person said, ""It's very good here actually. Overall, I would definitely recommend this home to  people."" A third person said, ""Overall, I would recommend the home to other people. I am very pleased to be here. We have residents meetings once a month – they ask if we are happy with everything. I am very  satisfied with everything."" Another person said, ""I would recommend anyone to live here – as it is very nice.""  A relative said, ""Really really good, great place, the thing for me is the consistency of care.""  All of the staff we spoke with told us they would recommend Summerfield Private Residential Home as a  place to be cared for and to work. Comments included; ""It's a nice staff team, carers are good and interact  well with residents. I very much enjoy coming to work."" ""It's a nice, friendly home to work in. The manager is  out on the floor and is approachable. I enjoy coming to work and wouldn't work anywhere else."" Staff told  us the manager and provider were very responsive if anything was needed, for example, replacement of  carpets or new equipment.  People and staff both said the manager and provider were friendly, approachable and helped deal with any  issues or problems that arose. We observed a friendly, visibly person centred culture within the home with  staff working well together to help ensure people's care experience was as positive as possible.   Systems were in place to assess, monitor and improve the service. Audits took place in a range of areas  including infection control, the homes environment and medicines. An overall care audit reviewed people's  care and support needs including care plan documentation. The manager also conducted regular night  checks to provide assurance the home was operating safely at night. A staff member reviewed daily care  reports made by staff on the computerised system each day to determine whether they were appropriate  and ensure the required care and support could be evidenced.  Staff confirmed meetings were held and they felt able to have an open discussion with the management team.  The minutes of these meetings showed  the service was committed to continuous improvement, with quality and care issues discussed to help  improve performance.  We spoke with the registered manager and deputy manager who both demonstrated they were committed  to continuous improvement of the service.  They attended conferences, training and read care relating  publications to keep up-to-date with best practice guidance.  We saw they had produced 'case studies' to  demonstrate where the service had helped people to achieve a positive care or support outcome. This  included learning points to further improve the service.  For example one case study demonstrated how the  service had successfully supported a person to make contact with old friends and their place of worship. The details of this were recorded to aid further learning and improvement.  Another case study demonstrated  lessons learnt as a result of a delay in a person receiving their medicines. Incidents and accidents were  analysed for possible causes to aid improvements to the safety of the service.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including the local hospital to ensure joined up care for   18 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  people.  For example staff helped people attend appointments and there was a dedicated care plan given to hospital and other professionals so these agencies had concise information on people's needs.    People's views and feedback were sought and used to make improvements to the service. Monthly resident  meetings were held which had a good attendance. We looked at the minutes of the February 2018 meeting  which showed people felt happy safe and comfortable. People discussed a range of topics including  activities and meals. We saw people's feedback had been acted on. For example people were asked if they  would like local nursery school children to visit and they had said yes. This was currently being arranged  demonstrating people's views were being acted on.     The last resident and relative's survey had been completed in July 2017 and we saw the results were  extremely positive which was in line with our observations and feedback people gave us during the  inspection. Comments included; ""Excellent place, great staff and management."" Staff show outstanding  empathy with residents."" ""Staff always cheerful, smiling and polite."" ""Has been in three previous homes and  I am happiest with this one and so is he.""; ""Residents always come first."" ""Residents are happy here."" ""The  home is well kept."" ""If I had parents still alive this is the home I would bring them to if they ever needed one.  It's like home from home."" ""The residents get what they want."" ""Nothing is too much trouble.""  19 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  "	 19 March 2018  received a range of training and support from the management team.   People had access to a good range of food with sufficient choice and variability. People's nutritional needs  were assessed and where people were deemed at risk, plans of care were put in place to mitigate these risks.  The service was compliant with the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) and Deprivation of  Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). People were supported to have maximum choice and control of their lives and  staff supported them in the least restrictive way possible. People's consent was sought before care and  support was offered.   The service worked well with a range of health professionals to help ensure people's needs were met. Care  needs were assessed and appropriate plans of care put in place. People told us care needs were met by the  service.   Staff were kind and caring and treated people with a high level of dignity and respect. Staff had developed  good relationships with people and knew them well. Care was person centred, focused on meeting people's  individual preferences and taking their views into account.  People had access to a wide range of activities  and social opportunities.   People were very satisfied with the service, but should they wish to complain, systems were in place to  ensure they were able to. Any complaints were logged, investigated and responded to in a timely manner.   There was a good person centred culture within the home and friendly atmosphere.  People, relatives and  staff all spoke positively about the way the service was run.    Systems were in place to monitor and check how the service was operating. Where issues were found, action was taken to ensure a high performing service. People were regularly asked for their feedback in a number of areas and this was used to further improve the service.  3 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.

People's views and feedback were used to make changes and  improvements to the service.   5 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018     Summerfield Private  Residential Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  At this inspection we  followed up on the requirement notice we issued at the last inspection in September 2016 to see if  improvements had been made.   The inspection took place on the 12 February 2018 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two inspectors and two experts by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service. The experts by experience had  experience of older people's care.   During the inspection we spoke with eight people who used the service, one relative and two visitors. We  also spoke with the registered manager, deputy manager, a senior care worker, five care workers, the cook,  the activities co-ordinator and a domestic assistant. We observed care and support, including the mealtime  experience and looked around the home. We looked at five people's care records and other records such as  medication records, meeting notes, accident and incident reports, training records and maintenance  records. Following the inspection we telephoned two relatives to ask them for their views on the service.   Before visiting the home we reviewed the information we held about the service which included  notifications sent to us by the provider. We contacted the local authority commissioning and safeguarding  teams to ask for their views of the service. We spoke with one health professional who works with the  service.   We used information the provider sent us in the Provider Information Return. This is information we require  providers to send us at least once annually to give some key information about the service, what the service   6 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  does well and improvements they plan to make.  7 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   	  Good  	"   People told us they felt safe living at Summerfield Residential Home. One person said ""Yes I am safe here, I  do feel safe at present."" Another person said ""If I didn't feel safe I wouldn't be here. A third person said ""Yes, I  feel safe more or less as much as you can feel safe. I don't get knocked about or anything like that here."" A  relative told us, ""Mum is safe here, I don't worry when I leave.""   Staff had completed safeguarding training and said they would not hesitate to report concerns to a senior  member of staff, the registered manager, the safeguarding team or CQC. We saw appropriate liaison and  referral to the local adult protection unit had been made following the identification of safeguarding  concerns. Measures were put in place following any safeguarding incidents to protect people, this included  safeguarding care plans where people were identified as being at risk. This helped keep people safe.   Risks to people's health and safety were assessed and mitigated against. This included the risks associated  with poor skin integrity, poor nutrition, moving and handling and behaviours that challenge. Risk  assessments were updated regularly and plans of care provided instructions on how to keep people safe.  Equipment such as air flow mattresses and bed rails were put in place following liaison with healthcare  professionals to help keep people safe. The service had recently made improvements to moving and  handling practices and had purchased new slings to ensure each person who required hoisting had their  own individualised sling. We observed people who had problems with their mobility being supported by  care staff. We saw one person being aided to move with assistance from a hoist into a wheelchair. Staff  explained to the person what they were doing whilst assisting them. We observed that the footplates on the  wheelchair were used. Our observations showed that staff assisted this person to move in a safe way.     Positive risks were undertaken to support people to maintain their freedom and achieve their goals. One  person had complex medical and mobility needs, but expressed a desire to go on a steam train. The service  had thought carefully about how this could be done safely and devised a positive risk assessment to allow  the person to go. Staff had reviewed the trip afterwards and recorded a positive outcome for the person.  Staff had concluded ""Just because there are risks and obstacles doesn't meant that trips out for people with medical and mobility concerns are impossible.""  This showed a good approach to ensuring risks did not  restrict people's freedom and ability to achieve their goals.   The premises was safely managed and suitable for its intended purpose. Checks were undertaken on the  gas, electrical and fire systems as well as equipment such as hoists to ensure they remained safe.   Temperature checks were undertaken on hot water systems to ensure they remained within safe limits,  although some outlets had not been tested for several months.  We checked some taps and found the water  temperatures to be safe.   Personal Emergency Evacuation Plans (PEEP) were in place for each person showing how to evacuate them  in a fire. These were stored electronically and also in a folder so they could be accessed quickly in the event  of an emergency. A fire risk assessment had been carried out by a competent person and the registered  manager had made fire safety improvements as per their recommendations.  8 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  We concluded there were sufficient quantities to staff to ensure prompt and safe care. Overall, people told  us they thought there were sufficient numbers of staff at the home. One person said, ""Oh yes, I feel very safe  in this place, because there is always staff about."" Another person said, ""I feel safe at night as there are three  staff on at night. If I press that button on that wall, they would come immediately."" A third person said,  ""There are enough carers here."" Staff we spoke with told us there were enough staff on each shift to ensure  people's needs were met. The registered manager told us staffing levels could be increased if people's needs changed and this was confirmed by staff.   Rotas' showed the required staffing levels were consistently maintained. The registered manager or deputy  were on call should they be needed out of hours in an emergency. The registered manager did not use  agency staff. When there were shifts to be covered existing staff picked these up so people were provided  with consistent care from familiar staff. The care team were supported by housekeepers, cooks, laundry staff and an activities co-ordinator. We saw there was a good staff presence around the home and heard call bells were answered in a timely way. We concluded there were enough staff to care for people safely and to keep  the home clean.  We reviewed three staff files and found safe recruitment procedures were in place to ensure new staff were  of suitable character to work with vulnerable people. New staff were required to complete an application  form and attend an interview. Disclosure and Baring Service (DBS) checks and references were then taken  up.  Any issues raised had been thoroughly risk assessed by the registered manager to ensure staff were safe  to work at the service.   Medicines were managed safely and people received their medicines as prescribed. People told us they got  their medicines consistently and on time. One person said, ""I am a diabetic. They [staff] have to do my  bloods every day. They [staff] manage my diabetes better than the nurses did when I was in hospital. Senior  staff give me my medication, which I always get on time."" Medication care plans were in place which gave  information, for example of any allergies and how people preferred to take their medicines. This  demonstrated each person had a personalised plan to support them to take their medicines safely.   We saw medicines were stored in locked trolleys, cabinets or fridges, all of which were clean and tidy. Senior  staff took responsibility for administering medicines and we saw them doing this with patience and  kindness. We spoke with a senior care worker who confirmed they had received training and the deputy  manager told us they observed staff administering medicines as part of their medicines audit. We looked at  a sample of medication administration records (MARs) and saw people were being given medicines as  prescribed. We checked a random sample of medicines and found the stocks being held were accurate. This  showed us medicines were being managed safely.  The home was also clean and free from odours in all of the communal areas. People living at the service  confirmed that the home was always kept clean and odour free. One person told us, ""The home is clean –  the bathroom, everywhere is kept spotless. It is always nice and warm here.""Another person said, ""The  cleaner here is one of the best I have ever seen."" A third person said, ""This is a nice, warm house – very clean  – we have cleaners in every day.""  Cleaning staff were in place and they said they had the resources and time  to keep the home clean. We saw staff adhering to good infection control techniques and checks were  regularly undertaken on infection control and cleaning practices.  We saw systems were in place to ensure  items were laundered promptly although due to space limitations in the laundry room, there was not a clear separation of clean and dirty laundry.   Incidents and accidents were recorded and action taken to reduce the likelihood of a re-occurrence.  Following each incident a management report was completed detailing the suspected cause and any action  9 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  needed.  Incidents were analysed each month to look for any themes and trends and to check that  appropriate action had been taken to prevent a re-occurrence. We saw following incidents such as falls,  liaison took place with district nurses and risk assessments were updated to help reduce the risk of repeat  incidents.  10 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   Care records demonstrated people's needs were assessed and people told us care was delivered in line with their wishes. The service subscribed to a number of publications to keep up-to-date with best practice  guidance.  The registered manager attended provider forums run by the local authority, which also helped  them keep up-to-date with best practice. They demonstrated to us they improved practice based on  research and guidance.  For example the registered manager had read a study with showed that people  living with dementia benefit from at least an hour of individualised interaction and activity per week. This  had led to them reiterating the importance of personated interaction with the staff team, arranging for staff  to spend more time with each resident.  They told us they had already seen positive outcomes in terms of  people's mood and behaviour and hoped to formally record their findings over the coming months.   We concluded staff had the right skills, knowledge and experience to care for people.  One relative said of  staff ,""Very good staff, all switched on."" Staff were knowledgeable about people and how to meet their  needs. Staff received a range of training relevant to their role. The training matrix showed staff were up to  date with training, or refresher training had been booked. Training courses included infection control,  medicines, first aid, food hygiene, continence care, care planning, moving and handling, palliative care and  safeguarding. We saw staff had also received specialist training in topics such as how to use food  supplements, diabetes and dementia care.  The registered manager told us new staff completed induction training and were enrolled on the Care  Certificate. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip social care and health workers with  the knowledge and skills they need to provide safe, compassionate care. We saw evidence of induction in  the staff files we reviewed. We spoke with one member of care staff who had been recruited recently. They  told us their induction had been comprehensive and had included a period of shadowing which they said  had helped them get to know people who used the service.   Staff were provided with supervision sessions which gave them the opportunity to discuss their work role,  any issues and their professional development. Staff also had an annual appraisal. Staff we spoke with told  us they felt supported and said they could go to the registered manager or deputy manager at any time for  advice or support.  People were supported to maintain a good balanced diet.  People spoke positively about the choice and  quality of food available.  Comments included, ""I have no complaints about the food. You can have what you want. I think you can have a cooked breakfast – not that I have one – but the gentleman opposite me has  bacon."" ""It's not so bad. I usually have porridge and toast. I could have a cooked breakfast if I wanted one.  Some people have bacon and eggs."" ""The food is good here. We all like good food."" ""The food is very good.  We have a choice – they will give you whatever you want for breakfast. If you wanted a cooked breakfast you  can have one. I have my meals in the dining room but you can have your meals in your room.""  Menu's showed sufficient choice and variation of food. There was a four week cycle of menus in operation  and the registered manager explained adjustments to these could be made to incorporate people's   11 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  preferences. The cook also catered for any special diet's such as diabetic and soft meals. Care staff made the cook aware if people were losing weight and meals and drinks were fortified accordingly. Jugs of nutritional  supplements and fortified milk were made up in the mornings so they were available when needed.   During  the morning we saw people being asked if they wanted drinks as we saw a drinks trolley being taken around  the home. We also observed jugs of both blackcurrant and orange juices, in the lounges as well as snacks.  Mid-morning drinks and snacks were on offer and mid-afternoon drinks and cake were served to provide  people with additional nutrition.   We observed lunchtime in the dining room and found it to be a positive experience. All the tables had been  set with cutlery and condiments. There were flowers and serviettes on each table.  We observed one person  who needed some support with their meal. Staff were supportive yet unobtrusive. People were also offered  clothes protectors before commencing to eat their meal.  We saw that people were given choices as to  where they wished to eat their lunch.  Some people had their lunch in their own rooms.   We looked at the care records for one person who had been assessed as being nutritionally at risk and saw  their weight was being monitored closely. We saw staff, patiently sitting with them, offering them  encouragement to eat and drink.  People had nutritional risk assessments and care plans in place which  were regularly updated. This provided us with assurance people's nutritional needs were being met.   The service worked with other organisations and health professionals to help ensure effective care and  treatment. People we spoke with confirmed they had access to health care services and reported no  concerns in this area.  One person said ""The district nurse come in regularly she is coming in today to see to  my leg."" Another person said, ""If I became unwell –they [staff] would get the doctor out."" A third person said,  ""If I became unwell they [staff] would get the doctor out straight away. If someone was admitted to hospital,  a summary care plan was sent with them so the hospital had information on their care and support needs.   We saw feedback had been received from the hospital praising the quality of the care plans which  accompanied people as well as the knowledge of the care home staff that had supported them.  This helped ensure people received good joined up care when moving between services.   The 'Tele medicines system' was in use at the service. This was a free system for care homes provided by the  NHS and run exclusively from Airedale Hospital. The NHS provided the home with a laptop and camera to  run the system, when this was set up the care home could get straight through to the Nurses Hub at Airedale Hospital for advice. This was a fully portable system and could be taken to peoples bedrooms where they  could speak directly to a nurse.  If there were visible symptoms the camera could focus on these and it  would show up on the screen for the medics to assess and give advice. It could also be used to get advice on medicines. If someone required hospital treatment 'Tele medicines' staff could fast track the admission.    Care records assessed people's health conditions and put plans of care in place for staff to follow.  In the  care records we looked at we saw people had been seen by a range of health care professionals, including  GPs, opticians, dentists and podiatrists.  Staff told us if there were any concerns about people's health the  senior members of staff acted promptly either by using the 'Telemedicines' system or by contacting a GP. A  senior care worker said if anyone was a bit out of character they would routinely get a urine sample to rule  out any underlying infection. We concluded people's health care needs were being met.  The premises were of high quality, appropriately designed and adapted to meet people's individual needs.   People's bedrooms were a reasonable size and overlooked the garden of the property. We saw that people  had their own television/radio as some told us they chose to spend a lot of time in their own room. They told us they did this because they preferred the quietness of their own bedroom. Some people had photographs  of members of their family around them on their bedside tables. One person had brought their own cat into   12 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  the home. They told us how much comfort this brought them. The person said, ""They [staff] even let me  bring my cat into the home, which was brilliant.""  We saw that communal areas were nicely furnished and decorated. The furnishings were of a good  standard. Communal areas were well lit. We saw that there were no light bulbs either missing or not  working, which meant that staff worked hard to maintain good lighting to promote a homely atmosphere  and help reduce the risk of falls.  The registered manager explained that bedrooms were always re- decorated before people moved into them to ensure a high quality living environment. We saw there was a  person centred approach to this. For example two male residents had agreed to move into a room together,  a large room had been chosen to safely accommodate the moving and handling equipment they required.  The room was being decorated and furnished to their preferences with a large flat-screen television being  placed on the wall.  This demonstrated a person centred approach.   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that, as far as possible,  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty so that they can receive care and treatment when this  is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The authorisation procedures for this in care  homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The service was acting within the  Mental Capacity Act. People's capacity to consent to their care and support arrangements was assessed.  Where people lacked capacity and it had been assessed that the accumulation of restrictions amounted to a deprivation of liberty, appropriate DoLS applications had been made. There was one current authorised  DoLS in place with other applications awaiting assessment by the local authority. The authorised DoLS had  one condition attached to it which had been met by the service.    People were asked consent before care and support was provided. Where people lacked capacity best  interest decisions had been made involving families and staff from the service. We saw clear best interest  processes had been followed, for example, for people who were moving bedrooms.  The registered manager had a list of Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) which were in place. A LPA is a legal  document that allows someone to make decisions for you, or act on your behalf, if you're no longer able to  or if you no longer want to make your own decisions. LPA's can be put in place for property and financial  affairs or health and welfare. This showed us the registered manager understood their responsibilities to act  within the legislation.  13 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   At the last two inspections we found a lack of person centred approach regarding some people's mealtime  regimes. We found there was not always an appropriate gap between breakfast and lunchtime, which  demonstrated a lack of person centred approach to care and support. At this inspection we found  improvements had been made. More thought had gone into planning mealtimes to meet people's individual needs.  People could eat at a time that suited them, and we saw appropriate gaps between meals for those  who needed assistance.   Everyone told us they were well looked after by staff. Comments included: ""They [staff] are all very good and  nice. The staff do treat me well, but I do think they work hard."" They [staff] are not so bad – they are easy to  get on with."" ""They [staff] are human – very friendly.""  ""The staff are very good here. I am very pleased with  the staff – they do their very best and are very helpful."" The staff are wonderful. They [staff] are brilliant and  all of them are very obliging."" A relative told us, ""It's fantastic here and Mum is so happy.""  We spoke with two visitors, who had turned up unannounced to see if the service would be suitable for their relative. They told  us they had been shown around everywhere and thought it was a warm, welcoming, friendly home with  plenty going on.    We observed care. People looked relaxed and comfortable around staff. There was a calm, friendly  atmosphere and we saw staff took time to sit and chat with people. We heard some good humoured banter  shared between people who used the service and staff which resulted in much laughter.  Staff took the time  to talk to people in between care and support tasks. This provided good companionship to people and  made for a lovely atmosphere.   Staff knew people well, for example, we asked them about one person whose care plan we had looked at.  They told us the person liked Opera music and fashion and always liked to be colour co-ordinated. We saw  this person looked well dressed and the entry in the daily records read, ""[Name] looks very smart this  morning with a pale yellow cardigan on, she chose her own clothes."" Person centred information on  people's likes, dislikes and history was maintained in care records which demonstrated staff had sought to  know about people to help provide individualised care and support.   Care staff were very considerate towards people, for example, at breakfast time one person complained  their coffee was 'horrible.' A care worker made them another drink and checked that one was alright before  continuing with their other duties. Another member of staff was sitting with three people in one of the  lounges and discussing with them what they might like to watch on TV. The final decision was a wildlife  programme.  People were able to express their views and were involved in making decisions about their care and support. During the inspection we saw staff asking people where they wanted to sit, what they wanted to eat and do.  Staff patiently waited for people to respond before taking action to meet their requests. Staff meeting  minutes showed that staff were constantly reminded of the importance of offering people choices, even if  they knew people's preferences well.  People had chosen décor, food and activities in the home.  This   14 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  demonstrated the service recognised the importance of listening and acting on people's views. People  confirmed they were able to make choices. For example they said they were able to get up and go to bed at  the times they wanted. One person said ""Yes, you can please yourself as to when you go to bed. I was very  tired yesterday- so I went to bed at 5:45pm – I know it was early but I was exhausted after so many visitors.""  Care plans showed that people and relatives had been consulted over care and support needs. Relatives  told us they felt involved in care and support decisions. We saw they were regularly contacted should  people's care needs changed. Relatives described communication as good.   We looked at whether the service complied with the Equality Act 2010 and in particular how the service  ensured people were not treated unfairly because of any characteristics that are protected under the  legislation. Our observations of care, review of records and discussion with the registered manager, staff,  people and visitors demonstrated that discrimination was not a feature of the service.  People were consistently treated with dignity and respect by staff.  We saw staff lower their voices to discuss  care and support tasks with people to maintain their confidentiality. Staff knocked on bedroom doors  before entering and ensured doors were closed during the provision of personal care.  If people's relatives  couldn't assist, the service supported people to attend hospital and other medical appointments.  This  helped reduce distress to people. This service was provided free of charge which demonstrated a caring  service.   We asked people about visiting times at the home. People told us their relatives and friends could visit at  any time and that they were unaware of any restrictions. One person said, ""Yes. I do get visitors. They can  visit at any time. There are no restrictions."" Another person said, ""Yes, my neighbours visit every week. There  are no restrictions as to when they visit.""  15 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People told us there was a personalised approach to care and support. For example people said they could  follow their preferred daily regimes. They said care was appropriate and met their individual needs.  A  relative said there had been an ""amazing transformation"" in their relatives' condition since they moved to  the home and their care needs were consistently met.  Another relative said, ""They do look after people  really really well"".   Electronic care records were maintained which showed people's needs had been assessed in a range of  areas including nutrition, mobility, social activities and personal care. Regular entries of the care provided  were inputted by care staff. We looked at these which demonstrated people had received the required care  and support interventions. Care and support plans were regularly updated and reviewed when people's  needs changed. This helped ensure responsive care.   The registered manager and deputy manager had attended an information session held by Bradford Council relating to the Accessible Information Standards. They understood their responsibilities in relation to this.  People's care plans gave clear information to staff about people's individual communication needs. For  example one person was partially sighted and there were clear instructions recorded on how to meet their  needs.  We saw staff adapting the way they communicated with people dependant on their individual  communication abilities.   People had access to a wide range of activities which were positively received by people. Comments  included: ""We have a bit of dancing, exercise with a ball."" ""You can go out for a walk if you want to."" ""We  have an entertainments girls who is always organising things. Mondays – we have music – we have a lady  who comes and plays the harp. Next month we have some Alpacas vising the home. We are going out to  Embsay railway. We have been to Scarborough, Bolton Abbey and the Carlisle railway. I like spending a lot of time in my own room – as I like to watch television. I also like sitting outside – when it's good weather."" On  the day of the inspection, people were celebrating one person's birthday in the main lounge near to the  office, during our visit. People were enjoying music, singing, drinks and birthday cake.  An activities co-ordinator was employed who worked four days a week. The programme of activities was on  display in the dining room, which included arts and crafts, light exercises, film afternoon and trips out. There  were also outside entertainers who came into the home. For example, every Monday evening there was a  sing- a-long with The Music Man, Golden Oldies on the first Thursday of every month and Healing Music. On  Friday mornings people could go out to visit Silsden Methodist Church. The activities co-ordinator also  arranged trips out using a local wheelchair accessible Taxi service. These trips included Garden Centres and  Bolton Abbey.   The service undertook one to one activities with some people so they did not become  socially isolated. We saw examples where staff had played music through a tablet computer to people  individually resulting in positive outcomes.  Links to a local Primary School had been developed with the children coming into the home at Christmas to  sing. Arrangements had since been made for four or five children to visit the home every other Thursday to   16 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  read to the people who lived there. There were photographs on display of various events and people's art  work was on display. We concluded people were being provided with a range of activities and social  opportunities to keep them occupied and meet their individual and diverse needs.   People we spoke with knew who to speak to if they had a complaint or any concerns. They all said they  would go the manager. People said they were satisfied with the service and had no complaints. The  complaints procedure was on display and care plans contained information about the support people may  need in order to make a complaint. One relative told us they would feel able to raise any concerns with the  registered manager or deputy manager. We looked at the complaints log and saw any complaints which had been made had been fully investigated and an outcome had been reached in each case. This showed us  concerns were taken seriously and dealt with appropriately. A significant number of compliments had been  received about the service and these were recorded so the service knew the areas in which it exceeded  expectations. For example one said, 'Thank you all so much for looking after my mum and for all your  kindness.' Another said, 'We would like to say all your staff are wonderful , caring and respectful, we cannot  thank you enough.'  Care planning demonstrated the service spoke to people and their relatives to help establish their end of life  needs and wishes.  We saw examples where this had resulted in care plans being produced to guide staff on  the care required.   17 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018   "	  Good  	"   People and relatives told us they were highly satisfied with the service. No-one we spoke with raised any  concerns with us during our visit. One person said, ""Overall, I am happy with everything. The staff treat me  well.""  Another person said, ""It's very good here actually. Overall, I would definitely recommend this home to  people."" A third person said, ""Overall, I would recommend the home to other people. I am very pleased to be here. We have residents meetings once a month – they ask if we are happy with everything. I am very  satisfied with everything."" Another person said, ""I would recommend anyone to live here – as it is very nice.""  A relative said, ""Really really good, great place, the thing for me is the consistency of care.""  All of the staff we spoke with told us they would recommend Summerfield Private Residential Home as a  place to be cared for and to work. Comments included; ""It's a nice staff team, carers are good and interact  well with residents. I very much enjoy coming to work."" ""It's a nice, friendly home to work in. The manager is  out on the floor and is approachable. I enjoy coming to work and wouldn't work anywhere else."" Staff told  us the manager and provider were very responsive if anything was needed, for example, replacement of  carpets or new equipment.  People and staff both said the manager and provider were friendly, approachable and helped deal with any  issues or problems that arose. We observed a friendly, visibly person centred culture within the home with  staff working well together to help ensure people's care experience was as positive as possible.   Systems were in place to assess, monitor and improve the service. Audits took place in a range of areas  including infection control, the homes environment and medicines. An overall care audit reviewed people's  care and support needs including care plan documentation. The manager also conducted regular night  checks to provide assurance the home was operating safely at night. A staff member reviewed daily care  reports made by staff on the computerised system each day to determine whether they were appropriate  and ensure the required care and support could be evidenced.  Staff confirmed meetings were held and they felt able to have an open discussion with the management team.  The minutes of these meetings showed  the service was committed to continuous improvement, with quality and care issues discussed to help  improve performance.  We spoke with the registered manager and deputy manager who both demonstrated they were committed  to continuous improvement of the service.  They attended conferences, training and read care relating  publications to keep up-to-date with best practice guidance.  We saw they had produced 'case studies' to  demonstrate where the service had helped people to achieve a positive care or support outcome. This  included learning points to further improve the service.  For example one case study demonstrated how the  service had successfully supported a person to make contact with old friends and their place of worship. The details of this were recorded to aid further learning and improvement.  Another case study demonstrated  lessons learnt as a result of a delay in a person receiving their medicines. Incidents and accidents were  analysed for possible causes to aid improvements to the safety of the service.   The service worked with a range of other agencies including the local hospital to ensure joined up care for   18 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  people.  For example staff helped people attend appointments and there was a dedicated care plan given to hospital and other professionals so these agencies had concise information on people's needs.    People's views and feedback were sought and used to make improvements to the service. Monthly resident  meetings were held which had a good attendance. We looked at the minutes of the February 2018 meeting  which showed people felt happy safe and comfortable. People discussed a range of topics including  activities and meals. We saw people's feedback had been acted on. For example people were asked if they  would like local nursery school children to visit and they had said yes. This was currently being arranged  demonstrating people's views were being acted on.     The last resident and relative's survey had been completed in July 2017 and we saw the results were  extremely positive which was in line with our observations and feedback people gave us during the  inspection. Comments included; ""Excellent place, great staff and management."" Staff show outstanding  empathy with residents."" ""Staff always cheerful, smiling and polite."" ""Has been in three previous homes and  I am happiest with this one and so is he.""; ""Residents always come first."" ""Residents are happy here."" ""The  home is well kept."" ""If I had parents still alive this is the home I would bring them to if they ever needed one.  It's like home from home."" ""The residents get what they want."" ""Nothing is too much trouble.""  19 Summerfield Private Residential Home Inspection report 19 March 2018  "

Overallsummary  Good  Good  Good  Outstanding  Good  Good  –––  –––  ––– –  –––  –––  This inspection was carried out on 2 and 3 November 2015 and was unannounced.  St Brelades provides accommodation for up to 37 older ladies who are living with a dementia or Alzheimer’s and need support with their personal care. The service is a converted domestic property. Accommodation is arranged over three floors. Two stair lifts are available to assist the ladies to get to the upper floors. The service has 23 single bedrooms, and seven double bedrooms, which ladies can choose to share. Thirteen of the bedrooms have ensuite toilets. There were 36 ladies living at the service at the time of our inspection.  A registered manager was leading the service. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to manage the care and has the legal responsibility for meeting the requirements of the law. Like registered providers, they are ‘registered persons’. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  St Brelades provides a service to ladies only and the manager employed only female care staff to meet their  1  St Brelades 	 29/12/2015  	  needs. Ladies were treated with dignity and respect at all times. For example, staff explained the care and support they would receive before they received it and asked them what they would like staff to do and when.  was in place to evacuate ladies safely but staff did not know how to use it. Following the inspection the manager put plans in place to make sure all staff knew how to safely use the equipment.  The manager provided strong leadership to the staff team and had oversight of all areas of the service. Staff were highly motivated and felt supported by the manager and other senior staff. The staff team shared the manager’s philosophy of care and worked to make sure that care was always provided to a good standard. Staff told us the manager was approachable and they were confident to raise any concerns they had with them. The manager had taken action to continually improve the service. Consultants had been employed to review and make recommendations to make sure the service was the best it could be.  There were enough staff, who knew the ladies well, to meet their needs at all times. Ladies needs had been considered when deciding how many staff were required on each shift. Staff had the time and skills to provide the care and support ladies needed. Staff were clear about their roles and responsibilities and worked as a team to meet the ladies’ needs.  Staff recruitment systems were in place and information about staff had been obtained to make sure staff did not pose a risk to people. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records checks had been completed. The DBS helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and helps prevent unsuitable people from working with people who use care and support services.  Staff were supported to provide good quality care and support. The manager had a very good knowledge of dementia and Alzheimer’s and its impact on the ladies at the service, she shared this with staff to develop their skills. A plan was in place to keep staff skills up to date. Most staff held recognised qualifications in care. Staff spoke to senior staff whenever they needed to discuss any concerns they had about the ladies. Plans were in place to hold more regular meetings to give staff the opportunity to discuss their role and practice.  Staff knew the signs of possible abuse and were confident to raise concerns they had with the manager, senior staff or the local authority safeguarding team. Plans were in place to keep ladies safe in an emergency. Equipment  Ladies’ needs had been assessed to identify the physical and mental care and support they required. Care and support was planned with ladies and their representatives to keep them safe and support them to be as independent as possible. Detailed guidance had not been provided to staff in some care plans about how to provide all areas of the care and support ladies needed, however they received consistent care as staff knew them well. An independent social worker had reviewed the care plans and was working with the manager and staff to make improvements in line with best practice recommendations.  The ladies received the medicines they needed to keep them safe and well. Action was taken to identify changes in their physical and mental health, including regular health checks and GP clinics. Ladies were supported by staff to receive the care they needed to keep them as safe and well as possible.  The Care Quality Commission is required by law to monitor the operation of the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards. Arrangements were in place to check if ladies at risk of being deprived of their liberty and applications had been made to the authority where they were necessary.  Consent to care had been obtained from the ladies or those legally able to make decisions in their best interests. Ladies who had capacity were supported to make decisions and choices. The manager had recognised that processes were not in operation to assess if ladies were able to make decisions or to make decisions in their best interest. This had been discussed with the independent social worker and action was being taken to put systems into operation that met the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA).  The ladies were supported to participate in a wide variety of activities that they enjoyed. Possible risks to them had been identified and were managed to keep them as safe as possible, without restricting them. Ladies were supported to continue to attend activities outside of the service, such as attending church services.  2  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Summary of findings  Ladies told us they liked the food at St Brelades. They were offered a balanced diet that met their individual needs, including soft diets for ladies who had difficulty swallowing. A wide range of foods were on offer to the ladies each day and they were provided with frequent drinks to make sure they were hydrated.  The ladies and their representatives were confident to raise concerns and complaints they had about the service with the manager and staff and had received a satisfactory response.  The manager frequently worked on the floor with ladies and staff to check that the quality of the service was to the standard they required. Any shortfalls found were addressed quickly to prevent them from occurring again. Ladies and their relatives were asked about their experiences of the care and these were used to improve and develop the service.  The environment was safe, clean and homely. Maintenance and refurbishment plans were in place and dining rooms were being redecorated during our inspection. Appropriate equipment was provided to support the ladies to remain independent and keep them safe. Safety checks were completed regularly.  Accurate records were kept about the care and support ladies received and about the day to day running of the service and provided staff with the information they needed to provide safe and consistent care and support to the ladies.  We last inspected St Brelades in April 2014.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 2 and 3 November 2015 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of one inspector and an expert by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service.  Prior to the inspection we looked at previous inspection reports and notifications received by CQC. Notifications are information we receive from the service when significant events happen, like a death or a serious injury.  During our inspection we spoke with four ladies living at St Brelades, the registered manager, 10 staff, and three ladies relatives. We visited ladies’ bedrooms, with their permission; we looked at care records and associated risk assessments for five ladies. We looked at management records including staff recruitment, training and support records, health and safety checks for the building, and staff meeting minutes. We observed the support provided to ladies. We looked at ladies’ medicines records and observed ladies receiving their medicines.  6  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  	  	  Everyone we spoke with told us they felt safe at St Brelades. One lady told us, “I feel safe, there are always lots of people around”. Another lady told us, “As my home, it feels safe and comfortable”. One ladies relative told us, “It is very safe here. There are always lots of staff around and I would say if there was something wrong”.  The ladies received consistent care, when they needed it, from staff who knew them very well. The manager told us that staffing levels were based on the skills of the staff. They had also considered the ladies needs and preferred routines and the layout of the building when deciding how many staff to deploy at different times of the day. Mornings were a busy time of day and a minimum of 11 care staff provided the ladies care and support.  Staff told us they were not rushed and had time to spend with the ladies providing their care and support at their pace and responding to changes in their mood. The manager told us, “The care is not a production line. I want staff to have time to connect with the ladies and be responsive to them”. All the staff we spoke with said that they had time to spend with ladies and were not rushed. One staff member said, “We get time to spend with the ladies and give them good quality care”.  Night staff supported ladies who wanted to get up early. Ladies who woke during the night or very early were supported to go back to bed if they preferred. Staff worked to support the ladies to have regular day and night routines to help them sleep at night. Extra staff were deployed over the weekends and on other occasions such as Mothering Sunday and Christmas Day when a higher number of people visited the service on the same day.  Staff shifts were planned in advance and rotas were available and staff knew when they would be working. Cover for staff sickness and holidays was provided by other staff members in the team. An on call system was in place and management cover was provided at the weekends and in the evenings by the manager and clinical manager. The manager told us, “Staff have to feel supported at all times”. The staff team was consistent and staff turnover was low, some staff had worked at the service for 30 years. There were no staff vacancies at the time of our inspection.  There were policies and processes were in place to keep ladies safe, these were known and understood by staff.  7  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  Staff had completed safeguarding training and knew the signs of possible abuse, such as bruising or changes in a ladies’ behaviour. They were confident to raise safeguarding concerns or whistle-blow to relevant people, such as the manager, clinical manager or the local authority safeguarding team. Staff told us they were confident that the managers would deal with any concerns they raised. One staff member said, “I have absolute confidence that [manager] and [clinical manager] would do something about safeguarding concerns”.  The manager encouraged staff to work as a team and understand they were working with colleagues and not friends. The risks of collusion with neglect and poor practice were explained and staff were encouraged to raise any concerns they had quickly. Staff told us they would be confident to whistleblow if they had any concerns. The manager told us they preferred to address any concerns at an early stage to prevent them from getting worse or going on for a period of time.  Risks had been assessed and care had been planned to keep the ladies safe while maintaining their independence. The manager had employed two occupational therapists to review areas of the care and support ladies received. Their role was to ensure that ladies were supported to take risks where the benefit to them outweighed the impact of not taking the risk. Such as the risk of getting lost when going out unaccompanied, against the risk of loneliness, anxiety and depression if a lady was not able to continue with an activity they liked.  Some ladies were at risk of falling out of bed, action had been taken to keep them safe. Some used bedrails to keep them safe whilst others, who may climb over the rails and not realise they were at risk, had mattresses on the floor to soften their fall. Shortly before our inspection the manager had employed an independent social worker to review some ladies risks assessments. They had recommended that more detail of the risks and the actions taken, including who by, be included in the risk assessment. The manager had a plan in place to review the risk assessments and make the necessary changes.  Risks to ladies’ skin, such as the development of pressure ulcers, had been assessed. Action had been taken to minimise the risks and no one had sore skin at the time of our inspection. Special equipment, such as cushions and mattresses were provided to keep the ladies’ skin healthy, we observed these being used.  Is the service safe?  Accidents and incidents involving the ladies were recorded. The manager had recently introduced a process to review accidents to look for patterns and trends so that the care ladies received could be changed or advice sought to keep them safe. Ladies had been referred to health care professionals for support and advice if they had fallen. The support and advice was used to plan the care they received and the number of falls had reduced. Staff were informed of changes in the way risks to the ladies were managed during the handover at the beginning of each shift. Changes in the support ladies were offered were also recorded in their care plans so staff could catch up on changes following leave or days off.  Plans were in place to evacuate the ladies in the event of an emergency. Staff did not know about these plans, however, staff knew what action to take in an emergency to keep the ladies safe. Special equipment was available to support the ladies to evacuate safely; however staff had not received training in how to use it safely. Following the inspection the manager informed us that they had put plans in place to make sure that all staff knew how to use evacuation equipment. Staff were confident to contact the manager or clinical manager for support in an emergency.  The service was clean and odour free. All areas of the service were cleaned regularly and three domestic staff worked at the service each day. Special antibacterial curtains were used to screen ladies beds and were replaced according to the manufactures instructions. The local district council environmental health department had awarded the service a 5 star rating for food hygiene and safety in August 2015.  The building and equipment were well maintained and regular checks, such as hoist safety and electrical checks had been completed. Maintenance plans were in place. Some areas of the home had been redecorated and others were being decorated. One dining room was being decorated at the time of our inspection. Neutral colours had been chosen and patterns had been kept to a minimum. When ladies could not find their way around the service, staff accompanied them to where they wanted to go.  Baths were fitted with hoists and ladies used these to get in and out of the bath safely. The temperature of bath water was checked before ladies used them. A small garden and enclosed courtyard were available for ladies to use. Ladies told us they enjoyed going into the garden in the fine  8  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  weather. One lady told us, “I enjoy sitting in the garden when the weather was good”. The building was secure and the identity of people was checked before they entered. Internal doors were not locked, ladies moved freely around the service and were not restricted. Risks to ladies from the environment, such as flooring, had been assessed and action taken to keep them safe.  A call bell system was fitted in ladies’ bedrooms. This was not used often as staff checked on ladies who chose to stay in the bedrooms often. One lady told us, “I just call out and someone always comes”. Staff were present in communal areas with ladies at all times and worked as a team to make sure ladies were safe. The manager told us, “Staff have to be very active in monitoring the ladies”.  There was enough space and furniture to allow the ladies to spend time with each other or alone when they wanted to. Furniture was of a domestic nature and the service was comfortable and homely. Ladies were able to bring small items of furniture and personal items with them into the service and these were on display in their bedrooms.  Staff recruitment systems protected ladies from staff who were not safe to work in a care service. The manager planned staff recruitment in advance and tried to anticipate when new staff would be required. Before staff were interviewed they were asked to complete some research into dementia and Alzheimer’s and questions about the conditions were asked at interview. Other interview questions required candidates to reflect on the skills they could bring to the role. They spent time in the ladies company and their interactions and responses were used as part of the selection process. Candidates who did not have experience had been recruited because they had the attitudes the manager required of staff, including a “natural warmth, kindness and respect”. The manager told us that if candidates were very good she would employ them even if she did not have a vacancy to make sure that she had sufficient staff with the skills, knowledge and attitudes required to provide the service.  Information about staff’s conduct in previous employment had been obtained. Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal records checks had been completed. The DBS helps employers make safer recruitment decisions and helps prevent unsuitable people from working with people who use care and support services. Information about candidate’s physical and mental health had been requested and checked. Other checks, including identity  Good –––  Is the service safe?  checks, had been completed. Processes were in place to dismiss staff whose practice did not reach the required level and refer them to the relevant authorities to make sure they did not work with vulnerable people in the future.  Processes were in operation to protect ladies from the risks of unsafe management of medicines, including systems for ordering, checking, disposal and administration of prescribed medicines. Medicines were stored securely and the storage room well organised. Ladies received their medicines at the time advised by their doctor. Staff gave ladies their medicines and reminded them how to take them safely. Staff’s medicines administration skills were assessed following their training and before they began to administer medicines to ladies.  Some ladies were prescribed medicines ‘when required’, such as pain relief or to help them manage their anxiety. Staff asked ladies if they wanted pain relief regularly and only gave it when they wanted it. When ladies were not able to tell staff they needed pain relief, staff observed their body language and their mood. Staff knew when ladies required medicines to help with their mood and agreement for this to be given was obtained from the person in charge before it was administered. Detailed records were kept of when ladies had taken their ‘when required’ medicine.  Staff had a good understanding of safe medicine management. They were knowledgeable and able to explain the action they would take to manage medicines safely.  9  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  	  	"  The ladies were able to make choices about all areas of their lives, such as when they got up and when they went to bed. One lady told us, “I get up about 7.30 and go to bed when I like”. Another lady told us, ""I used to be very active but now don't get around much but I get up and go to bed when I like”. Ladies choose how they spent their time and who they spent it with. We observed them being offered choices and staff responded consistently to the choices they made.  Staff knew the ladies very well. They understood what the they were telling them and knew how to share information with the them so they would understand it. For example, staff knew that some ladies would not remember complex instructions, when they asked where their bedroom was, staff smiled at them kindly and told them, “I’ll show you were it is” and walked with the lady to their bedroom. Some ladies were not able to hear very well and staff took time to make sure they understood what they were telling them, including writing things down and checking with ladies that they had heard them correctly.  Staff had received training in relation to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). The manager had recognised that they needed to develop their knowledge further and make sure that the practice at the service met the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act. They had employed an independent social worker to review the practice and put processes in place to make sure that ladies’ capacity was assessed and decisions were made in accordance with the Act.  Most ladies were unable to make complex decisions about the care and treatment they received and needed other people to make these decisions in their best interests. Decisions made in ladies’ best interests had been made by friends and relatives who knew them well, with health and social care professionals on occasions. However, the ladies’ capacity to make the decision had not been assessed and records of how the decision made in their best interests had not been maintained. This did not impact on the ladies and all decisions had been made in their best interests by people who knew them well. Some ladies were unable to make simple decisions, such as what they wanted to eat or drink. Staff knew them well, they knew the choices they had made previously and observed their body language to  10  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  understand what they wanted. Other ladies were able to chat to staff and tell them what they wanted. Staff demonstrated that they understood how to communicate effectively with the ladies.  Staff understood what the ladies were telling them and supported them to make decisions. We observed staff respecting decisions ladies made and offering them alternative choices to keep them safe and well. For example, at lunchtime we observed one lady refuse their lunch. Staff encouraged the lady to eat in a gentle way and offered alternatives they knew she liked when she continued to refuse. The lady refused the alternative and staff spent time sitting with her chatting about other things that interested her. We later saw the lady eat their meal and the alternative when they were ready.  CQC is required by law to monitor the operation of the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) which applies to care homes. These safeguards protect the rights of people using services by ensuring that if there are any restrictions to their freedom and liberty, these have been agreed by the local authority as being required to protect the person from harm. The manager was aware of their responsibilities under DoLS and had employed an independent social worker to support them to put processes in place check the risk of ladies being deprived of their liberty. Applications had been made for urgent and standard authorisations were ladies were at high risk. We observed that ladies moved freely about the building.  Staff told us they had completed training and had the skills and competence they needed to fulfil their roles. We observed that staff knew what they were doing. Staff had received an induction when they started work at the service to get to know the ladies, the care and support they needed and to understand their roles and responsibilities. The induction started before staff began working with the ladies and included three or four, two hour ‘pre-employment training sessions’, including the provider’s philosophy of care, safeguarding and moving and handling. New staff were working towards the Care Certificate, which is an identified set of standards that social care workers adhere to in their daily working life. New staff worked along experienced staff to help them build relationships with the ladies and provide care in a consistent way.  Staff received the training they needed to perform their duties, including first aid, fire safety and end of life care. A  Is the service effective?  training plan was in place and the manager knew what training staff had been completed and when it needed to be refreshed. Staff had completed further qualifications and many staff team had acquired level 2 or 3 qualifications in social care.  Staff received in depth training and mentoring in relation to the care of people with dementia and Alzheimer’s from the manager and other experienced staff. Some staff had other formal qualifications which informed their practice at the service. For example, the clinical manager was a registered nurse and although she could not practice nursing at the service because it was not registered to provide this, she could use her clinical skills to support the ladies and communicate effectively with health care professionals.  Staff told us they felt supported by the manager and the clinical manager to deliver safe and effective care. Staff did not have regular meetings with senior staff to talk about their role and the ladies they provided care and support to. However, they told us they were able to raise any concerns they had about ladies with the manager, clinical manager and team leader quickly as they were always available and worked alongside them. The clinical manager and team leader told us that they discussed staff practice, as well as ladies needs, with staff throughout the shift to make sure they were supported to provide effective care. Plans were being put in place at the time of the inspection to make sure that each staff member received six supervision sessions each year in addition to the day to day support they received. An annual appraisal process was in operation.  The ladies were supported to maintain good health. The manager worked with each lady and their family to get a true diagnosis of their dementia condition, and a prognosis. The manager and staff were aware of other illness that may affect each lady and monitored for these so they could be quickly identified. A doctor was contracted by the manager to provide a service at St Brelades, including a weekly surgery at the service, telephone consultations and home visits when ladies needed them. This meant that any concerns the ladies had about their health were shared with their doctor quickly. Other health care professionals, including a chiropodist and optician visited regularly. One lady told us, ""My teeth are dreadful  11  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  they seem to be falling out and I might have to have dentures but it’s all in hand"". The manager had arranged for the lady to see a dentist and receive the treatment they needed.  Care was provided to meet ladies’ health care needs. The ladies had been offered an annual flu vaccination. Staff worked with community nurses to assess and meet the ladies’ needs. At the time of the inspection several ladies had been assessed for continence products. St Brelades had supplied the products they required while they waited for supplies to be delivered. Community nurses visited some ladies to provide treatment for short term illnesses and when they reached the end of their life.  Staff from St Brelades worked closely with the local mental health team to support the ladies to maintain good mental health as their dementia and Alzheimer’s progressed. Community psychiatric nurses held clinics at the service every three months. Referrals to mental health services were made promptly when staff identified changes in ladies mental health.  The ladies were supported by staff or people who knew them well to attend health care appointments, including emergency visits to hospital or outpatient appointments. This was to support the ladies to tell their health care professional about their health and medicines and to make sure that any recommendations were acted on when they returned to the service.  Meals times were pleasant, social occasions at St Brelades and ladies enjoyed their meals in a calm environment. Meals were provided in different areas of the service dependant on ladies’ needs and preferences. Ladies who required assistant to eat were supported to do this with dignity by staff who took time to make sure they were comfortable and ate at their own pace. Other ladies ate in a quiet dining room where distractions were kept to a minimum. This meant that they did not lose concentration and remained as independent as possible at mealtimes.  Ladies told us they had enough to eat and drink. Food and drinks were offered regularly throughout the day and were available if ladies wanted them during the night. Snacks were offered between meals, such as afternoon tea and cakes, which the ladies enjoyed. Staff offered ladies drinks frequently to make sure they did not become dehydrated. Ladies were offered adapted cups, cutlery and crockery to help them eat and drink independently.  Is the service effective?  Ladies told us they liked the food at the service. One lady said, “The food is very good and I get plenty of it, there is a good choice of fresh vegetables”. Another lady told us they enjoyed the food at the service and said ""it is nicely cooked"". We observed ladies eating the meals and snacks they were offered. Ladies were offered second helpings of things they particularly liked, such as puddings. Their nutrition and hydration needs were regularly assessed and reviewed and action was taken to meet ladies’ needs. When ladies lost weight they were quickly referred to health care professionals including the dietician for support and advice. Their advice had been put into action and they had gained weight.  Meals were planned to meet ladies’ needs and preferences. Ladies who were at risk of losing weight were offered fortified foods and drinks including custard and milky drinks made with double cream. Ladies who required a low sugar diet were offered the same foods as everyone else but made with sweetener rather than sugar. Vegetarian  Good –––  options were available. Some ladies were at risk of choking and required their food to be pureed. Food were presented separately and looked appetising. Meats were minced for other ladies who required a soft diet.  Menus were balanced and included fresh fruit and vegetables. All meals were homemade, including homemade cakes and puddings. Sandwiches with a variety of high protein fillings were made throughout the day and ladies could have a sandwich whenever they wanted. Staff knew ladies’ likes and dislikes and offered them alternatives if they did not fancy the food they were offered. For example, staff knew who did not like fish and alternatives were offered when fish was on the menu. Staff told us they some ladies preferred alternatives such as egg and chips to fish and chips.  Communication between care staff and catering staff was good. Catering staff were told quickly about changes in ladies’ needs. The chef on duty during the inspection to us, “The girls (care staff) tell us immediately if someone needs a different diet. Things change all the time, no two days are the same”.  12  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  "	  	"  All the ladies we spoke with told us the staff were kind and caring, their comments included, “Everyone is very kind, they know what I am like. One lady’s relative told us, “The care is good, she is taken care of by the staff”. Staff told us there was a strong philosophy of care at the service. One staff member described it to us as, “The feeling that ladies get from staff, they may not recognise the staff member but they recognise the comfort staff give them. We look for signs that ladies may be anxious and try to make them feel safe and secure”.  The atmosphere at St Brelades was calm and welcoming. The ladies and staff were happy and cheerful, visitors told us they felt welcome. There was lots of laughter and smiling during the inspection and we heard ladies singing or humming or saw them tapping their feet to music. Staff spoke to us about ladies in a positive way and described them to us in terms of their personality and achievements, rather than their care needs. Staff took time to introduce us to the ladies, again describing them positively, such as “This beautify lady is ….”. Ladies responded with smiles. Care and support was offered to ladies in a positive way, with a smile, making each activity sound pleasant and enjoyable. For example, ladies were offered a ‘lovely bubbly bath’.  Ladies’ care plans contained detailed information about their lives before they moved into the service, including the different places they had lived, their family and jobs they had done. Staff used this information to help them get to know the ladies and provide their care in the way they preferred. Staff were able to anticipate times when ladies may become upset or worried and talked to them to reduce their anxiety, or offered them things to do which made them forget what was upsetting them. One person became a little upset and told the manager they wanted to go home. The manager chatted to the lady about where she had lived before and how she had told the manager she was worried about being alone during the winter and reminded her it was November. This calmed the lady and she decided to stay at St Brelades. One lady’s relative told us, ""My [relative] is comfortable here, she has had some difficult situations but staff diffuse the situation, talk to her  13  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Outstanding  –  and sometimes walk away with her and she calms very quickly”. Another lady’s relative told us, ""The staff know how to deal with the difficult situations when my relative becomes agitated and it calms down very quickly.""  Staff provided the ladies with information about their care and support before it was offered. For example, they told ladies they were going to move their chairs before they moved them and checked that the lady was ready. They continue to speak to ladies during the provision of care, such as, “We are just going to go backwards and them we will turn round”. Some ladies chairs were easier and safer to move backwards. A staff member usually walked in front of a lady being moved so they could see the staff member and feel reassured.  We observed several relaxed chats between staff and ladies, in small groups or one to one, about what they had done in the past. Staff used their knowledge of the ladies to start the conversations and involve others. One conversation started with a general question from staff about a pet a lady had had and led to a group conversation about pets, holidays and how ladies had cared for their pets when they went on holiday. The ladies enjoyed chatting and sharing their experiences and there was lots of laughing. They told us they always had someone to talk to when they felt like a chat. Ladies who did not feel comfortable to chat in groups chatted to staff on their own and staff made sure they were not isolated. One lady told us, “Staff respect that I am a loner, the staff come and talk to me but I do not like mixing with the others”.  Staff were highly motivated and inspired by the manager to offer care to the ladies that was kind and compassionate. They showed genuine affection for the ladies and ladies responded in a similar way. Staff approached ladies in a gentle way at all times, making sure they were at the same level as them and using their preferred name. Staff used touch, such as holding ladies hands or placing their hand gently on their arm or shoulder to comfort and reassure ladies. One staff member told us, ""I care about the ladies and it’s hard not to think of them as family, although I know they are not”. All the staff we spoke with said that they would be happy for a relative of theirs to receive a service at St Brelades.  Because St Brelades only provides a service to ladies and employs only female care staff, ladies always had a staff member of staff of the same gender to support them to meet their personal care needs. Staff had an awareness of  Outstanding  –  knew ladies’ preferred routines, such as where they liked to spend their time and who with. Some ladies had preferred seats in lounges and dining rooms, staff knew where these were and provided support in the way they preferred. Staff responded to the ladies’ requests, such as to stay in their bedroom or eat in a private room; this gave ladies control over their lives and reduced the risk of them becoming anxious or worried.  The ladies had privacy. Staff knocked on their bedroom door before entering. They described to us how they maintained the ladies’ privacy while they supported them to wash and dress. One staff member told us that ladies were supported to have privacy whilst using the toilet. She said, “I ask ladies, ‘would you like me to help you or would you like me to wait outside’”. Ladies who did not require help were given privacy to meet their own needs. One lady told us her ensuite was, ""Very important to me as I am very fussy about personal hygiene"".  Ladies and their relatives had spoken to staff about the care and treatment they wanted at the end of their life. Some ladies had ‘Do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation’ (DNACPR) decisions in place which staff knew about. Ladies’ preferred place to be at the end of their life had been discussed and some ladies had requested to stay at St Brelades if they were able to. Staff knew ladies’ spiritual preferences; such as if they wanted a priest and plans were in place to make sure these would be met. Other things that were important to ladies, including people, possessions and funeral wishes were recorded. One staff member described to us how they had been involved in assisting another staff member to ‘lay out’ a lady when they had passed away. They told us they had been unsure they could do it but were supported by the other staff member. They told us, “It was brilliant and it was so well done, I really felt I had done my best for that lady and it wasn't scary after all”.  Personal, confidential information about ladies and their needs was kept safe and secure. Staff had received information about how to maintain ladies’ confidentiality. Staff told us at the time of the inspection that most of the ladies who needed support were supported by their families, solicitor or their care manager, other ladies were supported by an Independent Mental Health Advocate and staff consulted with them when they needed to.  Is the service caring?  their impact on the ladies and the way they behaved, they withdrew when ladies demonstrated they did not want them around. When ladies required staff with them to monitor their safety, staff worked together as a team to make sure they were safe.  The philosophy of care at St Brelades was to support the ladies to maintain their independence and this was included in staff training and development. Care plans concentrated on ladies strengths and included information about what the lady was able to do for themselves. Staff supported ladies to retain their independence in all areas of their life. Ladies told us they wanted to stay as independent as possible and staff supported them to do this. One lady told us they needed ""Help with washing” and wanted to retain as much independence as they could for as long as possible. They said, “Staff allow me to be independent”. Another lady told us, “My independence is very important to me and staff respect that"".  Ladies were treated with dignity at all times. Staff asked ladies about their needs and offered them support in a discrete way. At lunchtime we observed two ladies leave and return to the dining room but we did not know why. Staff told us later they had supported the ladies to the toilet. Ladies who required a hoist to help them safely transfer between one piece of equipment and another were supported to transfer in their bedroom only. This maintained their privacy and dignity.  Staff treated each lady as an individual and with respect. Ladies’ choices about how they looked and dressed were supported by staff. A hairdresser visited weekly for the ladies who chose to see her. Ladies were supported to wear makeup and jewellery when they wanted and carried handbags. During the inspection one lady said she was cold and staff got her a cardigan that matched the rest of her outfit. Systems were in place to make sure that ladies’ laundry, including underwear, did not get mixed up and items were returned to the correct person. Staff did not call the ladies ‘dear’ or ‘love’ but referred to them by their title or preferred name at all times.  There was flexibility in the routines of the service to respond to changes in ladies’ needs and to their requests. One staff member told us, “We have to be vigilant to changes in ladies moods, how they feel and respond to these”. Other routines were less flexible to help keep ladies orientated to time and place, such as meal times. Staff  14  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  "	  	"  Ladies had been involved in planning their care, with their relatives when necessary. Some ladies were able to tell staff how they liked their care provided and told us that staff did as they requested. They told us staff knew what they were able to do for themselves and encouraged and supported them to continue to do this. One lady told us she needed some help with ‘washing her back’ and that she did not “Want to think about any other care, all the time I can manage"". She said that this was because she valued her independence and staff supported her to remain independent.  Some ladies were unable to tell staff how they preferred their care provided. Staff referred to information they had about the ladies and their life before they moved into St Brelades and observed their reactions to the care and support they were offered. They used this to understand the ladies preferences, including any changes in their wishes. This was a constant process as ladies preferences changed as their dementia progressed.  Staff knew about all areas of the ladies’ lives and the care and support they required. They described to us in detail the way that each lady preferred their care to be provided, including the support they required. Staff knew the equipment ladies used to move safely around the service and when they may need extra support. Staff knew the signs that ladies were becoming anxious or upset and ways to reduce their anxiety and help them remain calm and happy.  Before ladies were offered a service at St Brelades their needs were assessed to make sure the staff could provide all the care they required. Ladies and their relatives were also invited to visit the service before deciding if they wanted to move in. Further assessments of ladies’ needs, along with discussions about how they liked their care and support provided were completed to find out what they could do for themselves and what support they needed from staff to keep them safe and healthy. Assessments were reviewed regularly to identify changes in ladies’ needs. This information was used to plan ladies’ care and support.  Ladies’ care plans contained information about what they were able to do for themselves and how they preferred their care to be provided. Plans contained some specific  15  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  information about ladies’ choices and preferences. Information was provided to staff about how to reassure ladies if they became anxious, such as ‘reassure her and try a calm area. Try to divert and talk about dogs and football’. One staff member told us the care plans, “Are very insightful”, and provided staff with lots of information. One staff member involved in writing the care plans said, “We try to make the care plans person centred, for example we include the things that reassure the ladies”. Another staff member told us they provided them with information about how to “Prompt, encourage and care for the ladies”.  Detailed guidance had not been provided to staff about how to provide care to all the ladies. This had been recognised in the recent care plan review completed by the independent social worker. Staff understood the changes that needed to be made to the care plans to make sure staff had all the information they needed. The lack of information in some ladies care plans did not impact on the care they received. They received consistent care, in the way they preferred, to meet their physical, mental and social needs at all times.  Ladies’ care plans had been regularly reviewed to make sure they remained up to date. Staff told us that the care plans “might not all be up to date as things change quickly from day to day”. Systems were in place to make sure that staff had up to date information about the ladies, including handovers between shifts. Time was allowed for handovers in the shift plan and included strategies to manage changes in ladies care needs. Daily logs, including changes in ladies needs, were maintained so staff could refer to them when they returned from leave or days off.  The manager and staff knew that isolation was a risk for people with dementia and planned the routines of the service to reduce the risk of ladies becoming isolated, including social mealtimes and spending time with other ladies and staff they could chat with. Ladies were supported to follow their preferred routines, including spending time on their own if this is what they wanted to do. Some ladies found that sharing a bedroom reduced the risk of them being isolated or becoming anxious and depressed. One lady told us, “I love it here, I don't feel lonely as there are always people around”. Another lady told us, “I am a loner, it was the way I was brought up but that doesn't matter”. We observed the lady spending time in the company of other ladies when she chose to.  Good –––  Is the service responsive?  The ladies had enough to do during the day and spent their days doing activities including reading and listening to music. An activities coordinator worked at the home on four days a week and was supported by a member of the care staff. A variety of activities were on offer for the ladies to choose from each day. New activities were introduced gradually, ladies were able to explore and ask questions about them before deciding if they wanted to take part. An armchair exercise session, done by a visiting exercise instructor, took place once a week and ladies could join in if they wanted to. When they were unable to visit the service, such as when they were on holiday, the activities coordinator worked an additional day so ladies did not miss out on activities  On both days of our inspection a small group of ladies chose to knit squares to make a blanket and other ladies were doing jigsaw puzzles. Ladies and staff chatted together and some ladies chose to chat rather than participating in an activity. Music was playing in the background and ladies sung along. The activities coordinator spent time each week chatting to ladies who did not want or were unable to participate in group activities. Ladies were offered one to one activities with staff if they found being in a group caused them anxiety.  Ladies were supported to stay in contact with people who were important to them. Staff supported ladies to receive visitors at the service and to visit relatives. Ladies’ relatives  and friends were able to visit them at any time but were requested to avoid mealtimes to support ladies concentrate on their meal. Ladies were supported to continue participating in groups outside of the service, such as regular church services, that they had attended before they moved into the service. Services were held and communion given at the service for those ladies who were no longer able to visit their chosen place of worship. Representatives of different faiths provided the services to make sure that people were able to follow their beliefs. Staff made sure that ladies were supported to attend the correct service.  A process to respond to complaints was in place. Information about how to make a complaint was available to ladies and their representatives. The manager and staff supported ladies and their families to raise concerns or make complaints about the service. No formal complaints had been raised for over a year. The manager told us that any concerns raised were addressed immediately “So they do not escalate”. Action had been taken to address concerns or worries to people’s satisfaction. Staff recognised when ladies and their relatives had raised concerns about the service and had passed the information to the manager for their action. Ladies and their relatives we spoke with told us they had never had cause to complain about the service they received.  16  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  "	  	  The registered manager was also one of the registered providers and had been working at the service since it opened over 30 years ago. She knew all the ladies and staff very well. Staff told us they felt supported by the manager and senior staff at all times. One staff member said, “There is a lovely feeling about the service, it is warm and welcoming. I am confident it is a well-run home”.  Staff told us they were motivated and enjoyed working at the service. One staff member told us, “I love my job. The best bit is the ladies. I get a lot out of my job. I go home and I’m satisfied”. Another staff member said, “The ladies are fun to be around, we have fun together”. A third staff member said, “My job is really good, I really enjoy it”. Staff said they felt appreciated and were thanked on occasions for the work they did.  The manager had a clear vision of the quality of service she required staff to provide and how it should be delivered. One staff member told us, “I have the utmost respect for the manager’s knowledge and care. They have a zero tolerance to collusion and abuse”.  The philosophy of care at St Brelades was clear and understood by all staff. Staff knew the aims of the service and shared the manager’s vision of good quality care and supporting ladies to remain as independent as they could be. Values including privacy, dignity, and independence underpinned the service provided to the ladies each day. Staff had job descriptions and knew their roles. They were accountable and responsible for the service they provided.  Staff worked together as a team to support each other and to provide the best care they could to the ladies. For example, a lady asked a staff member for a cup of tea while the staff member was helping another lady. The staff member acknowledged their request and asked another staff member to make the lady a cup of tea, which they did quickly, so they did not have to wait. Some ladies required lots of support from staff and could become upset if they had the same staff member with them for long periods. Staff worked together to anticipate when the lady would like another staff member with them and took turns, this reduced the ladies worries. Staff asked each other for advice and guidance about the best way to complete tasks  17  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015  Good –––  and made sure that ladies were safe while other staff provided the care the ladies needed in private. All the staff we spoke with told us that the staff worked well together as a team.  Shifts were planned to make sure that the ladies received the care they wanted, when they wanted. The registered manager, clinical manager and team leader, were present in communal areas of the service during our inspection and demonstrated leadership and support to staff. Staff told us that they felt supported by the management team. They told us the managers were approachable and available to discuss any concerns they had. One staff member said, “The managers are very good at training us in what we need to do”.  Ladies and their relatives were involved in the day to day running of the service. Systems were in place to obtain the views of ladies and their relatives, including annual quality assurance questionnaires. Annual questionnaires were also provided to staff and visiting professionals. The process for 2015 was due to begin shortly after our inspection. The previous survey had been completed in November 2014 and showed that ladies were happy with the service they received.  Staff had other opportunities to tell manager their views about the quality of the service and make suggestions about changes and developments, including staff meetings and supervisions. Staff felt involved in the development of the service and felt that their views were valued. One staff member told us, “The managers are good listeners. They are very supportive, caring and motivated”. Another staff member told us, “We are not perfect but we try to be as good as we can be”. Staff told us that they were listened to.  The manager had the required oversight and scrutiny to support the service. They monitored and challenged staff practice to make sure ladies received a good standard of care. Staff told us that they told the manager about situations that concerned them, and were confident that they would be listened to and action would be taken. The effective running of the service was possible because of good communication between staff. One staff member told us the communication between staff was “Great”. Processes were in place such as handovers to share important information between staff.  The manager constantly monitored the care and support the ladies received to make sure that it was of a  Good –––  The manager worked to constantly improve the service. She had recently commissioned four outside professionals to assess the quality of different areas of the service, such as policies, and provide support to staff and herself to make any necessary improvements. The aim of these reviews was to make sure that the service was provided in line with best practice and current guidelines and was of the highest standard possible.  The manager had sent notifications to CQC when they were required. Notifications are information we receive from the service when significant events happened at the service, such as a serious injury to a person.  Is the service well-led?  consistently good quality. This included observations of support being provided to the ladies and chatting to ladies and their relatives. When areas for improvement were identified, action was taken to address the shortfalls found. Accurate and complete records in respect of each person’s care and support were maintained.  The manager kept up to date with the changes in the law and recognised guidance. They were aware of recent changes in health and social care law and the way that the Care Quality Commissions (CQC) inspected services. Policies were available in the service for staff to refer to when they needed them. The manager had arranged for a consultant to review and amend the policies and procedures to make sure they remained current and gave staff the information and guidance they needed to take the correct action at all times. The review was due to start shortly after our inspection.  18  St Brelades Inspection report 29/12/2015

Abbey Retirement Home provides  accommodation and support for up to 15 older people with mental health needs or people living with  dementia. At the time of our inspection there were 14 people living at the home.  The home had a registered manager who has been registered since October 2014. A registered manager is a  person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered  providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the  requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated regulations about how the service is  run.  People felt safe living at Abbey Retirement Home and they were very much at the heart of the service. The  risks to people were minimized through risk assessments. There were plans in place for foreseeable  emergencies.  Relevant recruitment checks were conducted before staff started working at Abbey Retirement Home to  make sure they were of good character and had the necessary skills. Staff had received training in  safeguarding adults and knew how to identify, prevent and report abuse. There were enough staff to keep  people safe.  People were supported to take their medicines safely from suitably trained staff.  People received varied  meals including a choice of fresh food and drinks. Staff were aware of people's likes and dislikes and went  out of their way to provide people with what they wanted.  Staff received regular support and one to one sessions of supervision to discuss areas of development. They  completed a wide range of training and felt it supported them in their job role.   Staff sought consent from people before providing care and support. The ability of people to make decisions was assessed in line with legal requirements to ensure their rights were protected and their liberty was not  restricted unlawfully.  People were cared for with kindness, compassion and sensitivity. Care plans provided comprehensive  information about how people wished to receive care and support. This helped ensure people received  personalised care in a way that met their individual needs.  People were supported and encouraged to make choices and had access to a range of activities. Staff knew  what was important to people and encouraged them to be as independent as possible. 'Residents meetings' and surveys allowed people to provide feedback, which was used to improve the service.   A complaints procedure was in place. There were appropriate management arrangements in place. Regular   2 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  audits of the service were carried out to assess and monitor the quality of the service.  3 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.

Good    5 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016     Abbey Retirement Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  The inspection took place on the 13 September 2016 and was unannounced. The inspection team consisted of two inspectors.   Before the inspection, we asked the provider to complete a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form  that asks the provider to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and  improvements they plan to make. We used this information when planning and undertaking the inspection.  We reviewed information we held about the home including previous inspection reports and notifications. A  notification is information about important events which the service is required to send us by law.  We spoke with nine people living at the home, and three family members. We also spoke with the registered  manager, a senior representative of the provider, the quality and training manager and three care staff. We  looked at care plans and associated records for four people, staff duty records, four members of staff's  recruitment files, accidents and incidents records, policies and procedures and quality assurance records.  We observed care and support being delivered in communal areas of the home. We also received feedback  from a health care professional.  6 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016   	  Good  	"   At our previous inspection of the home, which took place in June 2015, we identified infection control  guidance was not being followed and risks to people were not always managed. We asked the provider to  tell us what action they were taking and they sent us an action plan stating they would be meeting the  requirements of the regulations by August 2015. At this inspection we found improvements had been made  to infection control risks and risks to people were managed appropriately.  People told us they felt safe and were treated with respect. People said they felt comfortable around the  staff and they told us staff supported them. One person told us, ""I feel safe living here no complaints  whatsoever."" Another person said, ""I feel safe here, and staff look after me."" A family member told us, ""I find  the home brilliant mum is safe here and treated with kindness I can't fault it."" A health professional said; ""I  have no concerns about people's safety and would be quite happy if a member of my family were living  here.""   People were supported to receive their medicines safely. All medicines were stored securely and appropriate arrangements were in place for obtaining, recording, administering and disposing of prescribed medicines.  Medicine administration records (MAR) documented that people had received their medicines as prescribed. Training records showed staff were suitably trained and had been assessed as competent to administer  medicines.  Some people needed 'as required' (PRN) medicines for pain or anxiety. People had guidance in  their care plans so staff could identify when they required (PRN) medicines. One staff member told us these  guidelines helped to, ""Reduce the use of PRN medicines.""  One person told us, ""They will give me a tablet if I  am in pain.""     Staff were patient and caring when supporting people with administering medicines. One person was  reluctant to take their medicines. Staff stayed with them for a few minutes and after encouragement the  person agreed to take their medicines. Systems were in place to ensure that administration records were  regularly checked against stock to ensure that people were receiving the correct dosage of medicines. There  was a system was in place to record and report if people declined their medicines so appropriate medical  advice would be sought. Staff were knowledgeable about these systems and processes and had a clear  understanding of how they helped to promote safe medicines management in the home.  There were sufficient staff to meet people's care needs.  During the inspection we saw that staff were not  rushed and responded promptly and compassionately to people's requests for support. Staffing levels were  determined by the number of people using the service and their needs. Call response time in communal  areas were under a minute when people called out. A health professional told us, ""Seems enough staff  always someone about."" A staff member said, ""I feel we have enough staff. It helps that we have a cleaner on duty so we can spend more time with the residents which is better."" One person who was cared for in bed  had a call system to call staff, but staff also checked on them every thirty minutes to ensure they were  comfortable and had something to drink.   Robust recruitment processes were followed that meant staff were checked for suitability before being   7 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  employed by the service. Staff records included an application form, two written references and a check  with the disclosure and barring service (DBS). The DBS helps employers make safer recruitment decisions  and helps prevent unsuitable people from working with people who use care and support services. Staff  confirmed this process was followed before they started working at the home.  People were protected against the risks of potential abuse and had access to information about  safeguarding and how to stay safe. The home displayed a safeguarding board with information for people,  visitors and staff on the different types of abuse and procedures to follow. If they had any concerns  telephone advice numbers were clearly displayed. Staff had the knowledge and confidence to identify  safeguarding concerns and acted on these to keep people safe. One staff member told us, ""I had  safeguarding training when I first started, and if I had any concerns would report it straight to my manager.""  Another staff member said, ""If I had any safeguarding concerns I would go to management straight away.""  Risk assessments had been completed for the environment and safety checks were conducted regularly on  electrical equipment. People had individualised evacuation plans in case of an emergency. A fire risk  assessment was in place and weekly checks of the fire alarm and fire doors. Records showed staff had  received fire safety training. Staff were aware of the action to take in the event of a fire and fire safety  equipment was maintained appropriately. There were plans in place to deal with foreseeable emergencies,  the registered manager told us, ""If we had to evacuate we have an agreement with a local care home or if it  is for longer we can transfer people to one of our other homes."" Safety checks of water, gas and electrical  equipment were conducted regularly.  Risks and harm to people were minimised through individual risk assessments that identified potential risks  and provided information for staff to help them avoid or reduce the risks of harm. Staff showed that they  understood people's risks and we saw that people's health and wellbeing risks were assessed, monitored  and reviewed regularly. People were supported in accordance with their risk management plans. For  example, for one person records showed that they can be at risk of falls when they go into the garden and  staff were to ensure that they have their mobility frame with them when going into the garden. Risk  assessments were in place for moving and handling, mobility, health issues, fluid and nutrition, skin integrity and falls. A person who was cared for in bed had appropriate measures put in place around pressure relief,  fluid and nutrition in order to keep them safe.  People and their families told us the home was kept clean. One family member told us, ""The home is kept  nice and clean and there are no unpleasant odours.""  Staff followed a daily cleaning schedule and areas of  the home were visibly clean. Arrangements were in place to manage infection control.  All staff had received  training in infection control.  Staff had access to supplies of personal protective equipment around the  home to keep people safe. The registered manager told us, ""I walk the floor every day and look at the  environment, cleanliness, health and safety and people's appearance.""  8 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016   "	  Good  	"   People and their relatives spoke positively about the quality of the food. One person said, ""Food is excellent.  Everything is good."" Another person said, ""They will come around and ask what I want for lunch, you get  given a good portion.""  A family member said, ""The food is good I had a roast dinner with mum the other day it was really nice.""  Staff were all aware of people's dietary needs and preferences. Staff told us they had all the information they needed and were aware of people's individual needs. People's needs and preferences were also clearly  recorded in their care plans. People received varied and nutritious meals including a choice of fresh food  and drinks. There was a choice of two hot meals at lunch time and a choice of two different puddings. If  people did not want the choice on the menu they could chose an alternative. The dining room was  welcoming and tables were attractively laid out with tablecloths and fresh flowers.  When we visited the home it was a very hot day and the home had a heat wave plan in place. This involved  keeping windows open, closing curtains if direct sunlight was shining in the window and prompting  additional fluids. One person told us, ""They always come round with drinks, especially when it's hot."" They  closely monitored the food and fluid intakes of people at risk of malnutrition or dehydration and took  appropriate action where required.   Staff were skilled and knowledgeable about how to care for people living with dementia. One person told us, ""They [staff] all know what they are doing."" Training records showed staff had completed a wide range of  training relevant to their roles and responsibilities.  All training is now being provided in house by the quality  and training manager including, infection control, safeguarding, health and safety, food hygiene, mental  capacity act, food and nutrition, managing behaviours that is challenging, dementia, medicines, equality  and diversity and end of life. The quality and training manager informed us that fire and first aid training will  still be provided by an outside company. In addition a high proportion of staff had completed or were  undertaking vocational qualifications in health and social care. Staff praised the range and quality of the  training and told us they were supported to complete any additional training they requested. One staff  member said, ""My training is all up to date and I am now completing my NVQ3.""  New staff to Abbey Retirement Home completed a comprehensive induction programme before they were  permitted to work unsupervised. All new staff worked towards the completion of the Care Certificate. The  Care Certificate is awarded to staff who successfully complete a learning programme designed to enable  them to provide safe and compassionate care.   People were supported by staff who had supervisions (one to one meetings) with their line manager and  annual appraisals. Staff told us supervisions were carried out regularly and enabled them to discuss any  training needs or concerns they had. One staff member told us, ""I have supervisions every three months,  which are good.""  Staff had received training in the Mental Capacity Act, 2005 (MCA). The MCA provides a legal framework to   9 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves.  The act requires that as far as possible people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when  needed. When they lack mental capacity to take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in  their best interests and as least restrictive as possible. Where people had been assessed as lacking capacity,  best interest decisions about their care had been made and documented, following consultation with family members and other professionals, where relevant.  Staff were clear about the need to seek verbal consent before providing care or support and we heard them  doing this throughout our inspection.  One person said, ""When I say no [have a wash], they don't force me. I  do things in my own time but I do need their [help]."" One staff member told us, ""I always ask people for  consent. If they say no, I will leave it and try again later to see if they have changed their mind.""  People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are  called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the  principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty was  being met. DoLS applications were in place for six people and three further applications were being  processed by the local authority. Staff were aware of the support people who were subject to DoLS needed  to keep them safe and protect their rights  People were supported by health professionals and staff knew how to access specialist services for people.   A health professional told us, ""Staff are very helpful and management seem to be on the ball."" They also told us, ""Good working relationship with the home and I have no concerns. They always notify us if we need to  see someone."" Records showed people accessed a range of health care services, which included doctors,  chiropodists, and district nurses.   The home was easy to navigate and good signage was used around the home. The home had two lounges  which provided sufficient areas for people to relax, with a choice of seating in quiet or busy areas, depending on their preferences. Good lighting levels, and pictures placed at appropriate heights were used to create an environment suitable for people living with dementia. However we noticed clocks and calendars in both  lounges were showing the wrong day, month and year. Clocks and calendars are a good aid to orientation  for people living with dementia, but can confuse people if they are not accurate. We spoke to the registered  manager who was going to order some new appropriate clocks for the home.  10 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016   "	  Good  	"   People were cared for with kindness and compassion. One person told us, ""Staff are very good and very  caring."" Another person said, ""Staff are friendly and they are kind."" A third person told us, They [staff] make  an effort with us; it's the little things like that make it for me."" A family member told us, ""Staff very caring  couldn't ask for more 100% kind."" Other comments from family members included, ""Couldn't offer more"",  ""well cared for"", ""so thankful she is here"" and ""Staff are caring and very good.""  As well as, ""[carers name] is  very special mum loves her.""  When people moved to the home, they and their families (where appropriate) were involved in assessing,  planning and agreeing the care and support they received. A family member told us, ""I'm involved in care  plans and reviews and kept informed at all times.""  Staff had built up positive relationships with people. Staff spoke about their work with passion and spoke  about people warmly. Staff demonstrated a detailed knowledge of people as individuals and knew what  their personal likes and dislikes were. Staff showed respect for people by addressing them using their  preferred name and maintaining eye contact. One staff member told us, ""I enjoy working here. It's lovely  coming in and seeing the residents and it's a lovely place."" People were relaxed and comfortable in the  company of staff. All the interactions we observed between people and staff were positive and friendly. We  saw staff kneeling down to people's eye level to communicate with them. Staff gave people time to process  information and choices were offered. Although busy staff did not rush people when supporting them. We  heard good-natured banter between people and staff showing they knew people well. One person was  confused about what time of day it was as curtains were closed because of the heat and they became  disorientated. Staff were reassuring and patient with the person who quickly regained their orientation.    People were supported to maintain friendships and important relationships; their care records included  details of their circle of support. This identified people who are important to the person. People and their  families confirmed that the registered manager and staff supported their relatives to maintain their  relationships. One person told us, ""They [staff] always let me use the phone to call [my relative], it's never a  problem"". A family member said, ""We are always made to feel welcome. We have no concerns and have had  other family members stay here.""  Staff respected people's privacy and dignity. We observed care was offered discretely in order to maintain  personal dignity. For example when people got up out of their seats, staff checked that their trousers were  not tucked into their socks or their dress was caught round their waist. Staff monitored this discreetly as to  not bring attention to people. Staff knocked on doors and waited for a response before entering people's  rooms. One staff member said, ""If I am providing personal care I make sure it's in a private room with the  door closed and they are covered up with a towel."" Another staff member said, ""I respect people's choices  and if they don't want something I respect their wishes.""  The home promoted a dignity champion who kept updated by attending local forums on dignity and  sharing best practice. As part of an activity people were involved in a colourful board display which stated,   11 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  'our residents do not live in our workplace we work in their home.'  Staff understood the importance of promoting and maintaining people's independence. One staff member  told us, ""I promote independence, so if they can wash themselves I let them. Also little things like putting  their own butter and jam on their toast.""  Peoples care plans had details of how to support people to do  things as independently as possible. People who required prompting to use mobility aids, were prompted to be as independent as possible, and staff stayed with them and prompted safe use without over supporting  and taking away people's independence.  Information about advocacy services was clearly displayed on a notice board with details of how to access  services. Confidential information, such as care records, were kept securely and only accessed by staff  authorised to view it. When staff discussed people's care and treatment they were discreet and ensured  people's care and treatment could not be overheard.  12 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016   "	  Good  	"   People and their families told us they felt the staff were responsive to their needs. One person told us, ""They  [staff] have helped me walk again and must get credit for that."" Another person said, ""It's like a five star  hotel. I'm really happy here and I can't complain."" A third person told us, ""The garden is nice; I enjoy going  out there when it is hot."" A family member said, ""I think it's one of the best care homes."" The senior  representative of the provider told us, ""It's about being responsive to people's needs and knowing how far  the service can take them.""  Care plans provided information about how people wished to receive care and support. Assessments were  undertaken to identify people's individual support needs and their care plans were developed, outlining  how these needs were to be met. Care plans were comprehensive and detailed, including physical health  needs and people's mental health needs. For example, a communication care plan for one person stated  gestures they may use could be to blink their eyes to express uneasiness with a situation. Another person  had details about their religious beliefs identified in their care plan. The home organised for a weekly visit  from the priest on an on going basis as the person no longer felt able to attend church. Staff told us; ""Care  plans are very detailed. These have just been updated and are much better than the last ones.""  People's daily records of care were up to date and showed care was being provided in accordance with  people's needs. Care staff members were able to describe the care and support required by individual  people. For example, one care staff member was able to describe the support a person required when  mobilising. This corresponded to information within the person's care plan. Handover meetings were held  at the start of every shift and provided the opportunity for staff to be made aware of any relevant  information about risks, concerns and changes to the needs of the people they were supporting.   Staff told us they reviewed care plans with people monthly. Records of care confirmed that people received  appropriate care and staff responded effectively when their needs changed. People or their relatives had  signed care plans demonstrating they had been involved in identifying how their needs would be met.   People had a range of activities they could be involved in. People were able to choose what activities they  took part in and suggest other activities they would like to undertake. One family member told us, ""There is  lots of entertainment."" Another family member said, ""The manager gets entertainment in for people.""  Organised activities were held in the afternoon. These included board games, bingo, hand message and nail  painting, giant Ludo and giant snakes and ladders and puzzles. When we visited the home music was  playing in main lounge which people were clearly enjoying as some people were singing along to the various tracks. The registered manager told us about a new activity that had started in the home where  an outside  activity organiser comes in with a big screen and shows clips of various subjects with film and dance and  gets people involved by reminiscing for example '1950 music', and 'history of musicals.' The registered  manager said, ""We tried this and it was so popular and people really enjoyed it that we have now booked  them to come in once a month.""  We observed people playing giant snakes and ladders in the lounge which  was well attended and people were clearly having fun. Afterwards people were playing bingo with staff  assisting where required which again was well attended.    13 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  'Residents meetings' were held every three months and people's families were also invited to attend to.  Minutes from a resident meeting showed that most people had attended and that people were happy with  the food and activities. Staff told us this was a time to discuss any issues in the home. The registered  manager told us ""If we get a request we try and meet their needs. For example in the hot weather people  told us quilt covers were too hot, so we got some cotton sheets in for people and gave them a choice of  bedding.""  The provider sent out annual surveys to people and their families, and health professionals. The survey  results seen from May 2016 showed people were happy with the service provided at Abbey Retirement  Home. There were a couple of comments about having more choice on the menus. As a result the chef went  round to people and asked what they would like to see on the menu and made changes to suit peoples  dietary preferences.  People knew how to complain or make comments about the service and the complaints procedure was  prominently displayed. The provider hadn't received any complaints in the past year but the registered  manager described the process they would follow as detailed in the provider's procedure.  14 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016   "	  Good  	"   At our previous inspection of the home, which took place in June 2015, we identified the provider had not  notify us about all incidents as required. We asked the provider to tell us what action they were taking and  they sent us an action plan stating they would be meeting the requirements of the regulations by August  2015. At this inspection we found improvements had been made and the provider was now sending us  notifications.  People and their families felt the home was well run. One person told us, ""[The manager] is always smiling  and having a laugh."" Another person said, ""They run it well, the managers keep it all ticking over."" Other  comments included, ""It's a nice home, helpful people [staff]."" And ""I can't fault the place, first class."" A family member told us, ""Manager and deputy manager are great.""  There was an open and transparent culture in the home. The previous inspection report and rating was  displayed prominently in the reception area. One staff member told us, ""I feel it's an open door policy and I  can approach my manager any time if I have a problem."" Staff felt supported by the registered manager.  One staff member said, ""My manager is really approachable and I can have a chat with her at any time, if I'm  not sure about anything.""  Staff meetings were carried out every three months and minutes showed these had been used to reinforce  the values, vision and purpose of the service. Concerns from staff were followed up quickly. Staff were  involved in the running of the home and were asked for ideas. A yearly questionnaire was send to all staff.  Results showed staff were happy working at the home. Staff were satisfied with training and support and felt valued. Comments included, 'I enjoy work because of the people I work for.' As well as 'I feel inspired and  motivated.'   The registered manager used a system of audits to monitor and assess the quality of the service provided.  These included care plans, medicines, infection control, and health and safety. The registered manager told  us that in addition to the audits they walk round the home daily. They told us this was really important, ""as  people's happiness is my top priory, so I like to walk around to check people are happy and well cared for.""  The provider has two other homes as well as Abbey Retirement Home and had recently employed a quality  and training manager to cover all the homes. The quality and training manager told us, ""The registered  managers complete their own audits in the home. But I will follow up and check the score and see if any  action is needed."" They said, ""My role is to ensure systems and process are in place to monitor the care  provided."" A senior representative of the provider carried out monthly environmental reports of the home,  which included all internal rooms and the outside area and garden. They told us about progress and  measures put in place over past year. For example employing the quality and training manager to support  the registered manager which has seen an improvement in reporting and recording processes around the  home which has meant the service can be more responsive to peoples changing needs.  The registered manager informed us they kept up to date by attending provider forums to share best   15 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  practice with other providers. They also received regular updates from the provider and were in the process  of completing their NVQ 5. There was a whistle blowing policy in place and staff were aware of it. Whistle  blowing is where a member of staff can report concerns to a senior manager in the organisation, or directly  to external organisations. One staff member told us, ""I'm aware of whistleblowing and would go to my  manager or the director.""  16 Abbey Retirement Home Inspection report 17 October 2016  "

The provider of Oakleigh Lodge is registered to provide accommodation with personal care for up to 19 people. Oakleigh Lodge provides residential and respite care to people who have a learning disability, autism, and mental health condition or brain injury. Thirteen people were using the service at the time of our inspection, ten people lived in the main house and three people were accommodated in three of the four adjoining flats.  A registered manager was in post at the time of our inspection. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  At our last inspection of February 2015 the provider was not meeting one regulation that we assessed relating to  1 Oakleigh Lodge 	 19/02/2016  	  people’s care records. Improvements were also required regarding managing people’s medicines and providing additional staff training to ensure the care needs of people were met effectively. Further consideration of people’s capacity was needed to ensure their safety. The monitoring of the quality of the service needed strengthening to ensure any risks to people’s health and safety were managed. Following our inspection the provider sent us an action plan which highlighted the action they would take to improve. During this inspection we looked to see if improvements had been made and found that they had.  We saw that improvements had been made so that staff had the training they needed to administer people’s medicines safely.  People told us that they felt safe and we saw staff knew how to identify and report any concerns they had about harm or abuse.  People’s care needs were met by sufficient numbers of staff. Staff had access to a range of training which included additional specialist training to care for people who had complex needs. Staff felt their training and support helped them to develop the skills to meet people’s needs safely  We saw staff understood people's care and support needs and how to enable people to achieve their goals. People were satisfied staff cared for and supported them in the way they wanted. We saw staff were attentive and caring towards people. Staff used people's preferred  communication to ensure their individual choices were fully respected. They promoted people's dignity and privacy and supported people to follow their own interests.  Staff supported people to remain healthy and well. Staff monitored people's health and shared information effectively to make sure people received the right care and treatment. Staff followed the advice of health professionals so that any risks to their health could be reduced. People liked the meals provided and had been involved in planning and choosing what they ate.  People’s consent was sought before staff provided care or support to them. Where people were unable to consent to their care because they did not have the mental capacity to do so decisions were made in their best interests. Staff practices meant that people received care and support in the least restrictive way. The registered manager understood when people’s liberty may need to be restricted to ensure their safety so that any restrictions to people's liberty were lawfully applied.  We saw the provider had made a number of improvements since our last inspection. They had restructured the management team and improved their systems to monitor and review people's care. The provider had visited the home and carried out checks on all aspects of the service. He had provided opportunities for people, their relatives and the staff to share their experiences. He had made improvements so that people received a good quality service at all times.  2 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Summary of findings  Thefivequestionsweaskaboutservicesandwhatwefound  We always ask the following five questions of services.

This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This was an unannounced inspection which was undertaken on 5 and 8 January 2016 by one inspector.  We looked at the information we held about the provider and service. This included statutory notifications the registered manager had sent us. A statutory notification is information about important events which the provider is  required to send to us by law. We also received information from the local authority commissioners. Commissioners are people who work to find appropriate care and support services which are funded for by the local authority.  We met all of the people who lived at the home and spoke with seven people about their experiences. We observed the care of some people and observed their facial expressions and gestures to indicate their response to care. We also spoke with six relatives and a health professional by telephone.  We spoke with the provider, registered manager, deputy manager and three members of staff. We looked at the care and medicine records for four people. We also looked at the records about staffing, training, accidents, complaints. recruitment and the systems the registered manager and provider had in place to monitor the quality and safety of the service provided.  4 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  	  	"  At our last inspection in February 2015 we assessed that the provider had not ensured that staff had the necessary training to administer medicines via a peg feed, [a process where people needed to have their medicines administered directly into their stomach through a tube]. We assessed the arrangements and training in place at this inspection and found that improvements had been made. We saw staff had completed training in peg feeding. A staff member told us, “We had training from the external nurse and we have written guidelines to follow”.  One person told us staff,”Helped them with their medicines” and, “‘Make sure I have them every day”. We saw that the Medicine Administration Records (MAR) were correctly completed. We checked the balances of people’s medicines which matched their records. Records for the receipt and return of medicines were evident; an improvement since our last inspection. This is particularly important as some people had respite care and brought their medicines in from their own home. The Controlled Drugs register was completed correctly and these medicines were stored safely. Temperature charts were needed to ensure that the insulin was stored at the correct temperatures in the fridge. We looked at one person who was prescribed a medicine that thinned their blood. We saw the manufacturer’s supporting information was available. However due to the possible risks of a haemorrhage a written protocol with the MAR records would alert staff to the possible risks and the actions to be taken. The registered manager did this whilst we were on site to strengthen their procedures. We found that there was supporting information available that enabled staff to make a decision as to when to give medicines prescribed as ‘when necessary’. One person was receiving low doses of this indicating that other strategies to manage their agitation and anxiety were working. We suggested staff record this as part of the person’s monthly review to capture the fact that they had reduced the reliance on medicines.  People told us they felt safe living at the home. One person said, ""They (staff) are 100% at looking after me”. Another person told us, ""I can talk to staff if I was worried and they would help me”. A relative told us, “There were some safety issues that staff discussed with me and I’m happy with the arrangements now because [name of person] is kept safe”.  5 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  We saw that people who lived at the home were comfortable around the staff who supported them. They spontaneously sought staff out, spent time with them and from their smiles and expressions we found they were comfortable in the presence of staff. Relatives told us consistently that when their family member spent time at [the family] home, they were always happy to return to the care home. One relative said, “I can tell [name of person] is happy to go back because they get excited, smile and are eager to go. Once at the care home they settle straight back in; the staff are lovely”.  Staff were aware of the different types of abuse and the signs that might indicate a person was being abused. We saw they had taken action where they suspected someone was at risk of harm. This showed they had the confidence to raise their concerns and report them appropriately. One member of staff said, “We have done a lot of training around safeguarding which I really enjoyed and as a team we are much more confident”. We saw from training records that all of the staff had training and information on how to protect people from abuse.  Staff told us they were aware of whistle blowing procedures and we saw they had used these appropriately to raise concerns about people’s safety. At the time of our inspection two incidents were under investigation by the local authority. We saw the provider had taken interim action to protect people until these enquiries were concluded. A staff member told us, “I think any staff member would speak up if we had any concerns about the conduct of colleagues. We would be encouraged to”.  Staff were aware of how to manage risks to people's safety and wellbeing. A staff member told us, “Each person has a care plan and any risks to them are recorded so we have guidance about how we keep them safe”. We saw risk management plans were available for conditions such as epilepsy or dysphagia, [a condition that affects a person’s ability to swallow]. We saw that at mealtimes the staff supported a person in line with their care plan and that their food was appropriately prepared to avoid the risk of choking. Staff were able to tell us how they would respond to people’s epilepsy and how to manage their seizures. We found that plans described what staff should do in the event of a seizure and what medicines could be used in an emergency. We saw people had sensor equipment to alert staff to a seizure during the night. We saw staff supporting a person who had epilepsy and the support we observed  Good –––  Is the service safe?  matched what we saw in their care plan. We spoke with a person who needed equipment to aid their breathing during the night. They told us, “The staff check the machine is working and write it down”. We saw the person’s equipment was in working order and that a monitoring tool was in place which showed staff had consistently checked the equipment for the person’s safety.  Some people lived in the adjoining flats and received support from staff to help them develop their levels of independence. One person told us, “I like my flat and the staff help me with some things like money”. The person’s relative told us, “The staff have been remarkable; [person’s name] was vulnerable financially but they have sorted all that out”. One person had been identified as at risk living in the flats and their relative told us, “I’m confident now because staff recognised the dangers and moved [person’s name] as it was not safe them living on their own”.  We saw that there was a system in place for the registered manager to review accidents and incidents so that steps could be taken to help prevent them from happening again. The accident and incident logs had been reviewed and actions identified to reduce incidents. For example we saw that the provider had been proactive and had considered environmental factors. They had provided a ‘wet room’ so that there was less of a confined space when supporting a person with the aim of reducing their behaviours and anxieties.  The provider had arrangements in place to make sure suitable staff were employed. All staff we asked confirmed that checks were carried out before they were allowed to start work. This was confirmed from the staff files we looked at which contained references and checks with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS). A DBS check identifies if a person has any criminal convictions or has been banned from working with people. This gave assurance that only suitable staff were employed to work in the home. A newly recruited staff member told us, “I had to produce references and I had to have a police check before I worked”.  People and staff we spoke with told us that there were enough staff to meet people’s needs. One person said, “If I need staff there is always someone to help me”. Another person from the flats told us, “Yes I have the help I need the staff come over regularly and help me”. Staff told us that there was enough staff to support people and we saw people's needs were met in a timely manner. We saw people were supported to go out to pre-arranged events and spontaneous events. We saw people some had been supported to shop for their groceries and other people attended appointments. A senior staff told us, “We plan in advance so we have sufficient staff to meet people’s commitments”. Staffing levels were kept under regular review and for some people this included additional staffing levels to meet their needs.Relatives told us that they visited frequently and had no concerns about the staffing levels.  6 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  routines and what’s important to [name of person], I am very confident in the staff”. Staff had also had training in managing dysphagia. We spoke with the external health professional involved in the management of dysphagia and they told us they had no concerns about staff following their recommendations. Staff told us they were happy with the training and support they received to help them meet people’s needs.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interest and as least restrictive as possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met.  We saw staff were seeking people’s consent. Staff could interpret people’s gestures, expressions and actions which showed them if the person agreed to the support being offered. People we spoke with told us that they made their own decisions about their care; what time they got up or went to bed, what they ate, and decisions about their personal care routines. The care records we looked at showed where people did not have the mental capacity to make decisions about aspects of their care, relevant people had been consulted to ensure decisions were made in the person's best interest. Decisions regarding some people’s health had been made appropriately using this process. A relative told us, “I was involved in discussions about [name of person] because they did not have capacity [to manage this aspect of their care], I’m happy their safety was prioritised”. Staff were able to describe how a lack of capacity may affect the way in which they supported people. One staff member told us, “We ask people’s consent before we do anything”. Staff could identify those people who lacked capacity and how to support them and this was reflected in people’s care plans.  "	  	"  People told us that staff supported them in the way they needed and wanted. One person said, ""They help me to cook for myself”. Another person said, “I look after myself but they [staff] help me with my medicine”. A relative told us, ""It’s brilliant the way [person’s name] has come on; much happier, calmer and has started to engage with people”. Another relative told us, “Staff do a first class job, it’s head and shoulders better than anywhere else we’ve been, the staff are very good and seem to understand people’s needs really well”.  Staff told us they had an induction when they started working at the home which included working different shifts so that they became familiar with people’s needs and routines. Staff told us their induction, support and training had increased which enabled them to care and support people effectively. We saw the provider had implemented the new Care Certificate to enhance their induction processes further. The Care Certificate is a set of standards designed to equip staff with the knowledge they need to provide people’s care. There was documentary evidence to show all of the staff had a development plan and training record. A staff member told us, “This is the best period the home has been through. Staff are more confident, we have a lot of training and regular support, spot checks on our competencies, everything is more in-depth and we know what we are doing”.  Staff had access to specialist advisors, such as a psychologist who provided guidance on the importance of providing structure for some of the people. Training records showed that staff had also completed varying levels of recognised qualifications in health and social care to a level to meet people’s needs. Additionally we saw staff had received more specialised training in autism. We saw that staff recognised the importance for some people to follow their chosen routines. We saw a person present repetitive behaviours to which staff responded consistently and positively. We saw they understood the person’s specific behaviours as sensitivity towards textures which impacted upon their tolerance of clothes. A staff member told us, “The autism training was great; I learned such a lot and it helped me to interpret people’s behaviour and understand how best to communicate with a person with autism”. A relative told us, “They show a real insight and understanding of [name of person]; they know their  7 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  Is the service effective?  Staff understood it was unlawful to restrict people's liberty unless authorised to do so. We saw people's movements were not restricted and they moved around the home freely, some people went out independently. Staff we spoke with had received training in respect of the MCA and DoLS. The registered manager demonstrated she understood when applications for a DoLS should be considered and was in the process of making an application to restrict one person’s liberty for their safety. The registered manager told us that care plans were being updated so that they all included reference to issues such as capacity, consent and DoLs so that staff had the information they needed to support people.  People told us they enjoyed the meals and that they had a choice of what they ate. One person said, “I really like the food”. We saw meetings with people had been used to discuss menus and we saw choices were available. A new cook had been employed and one of the people told us, “The food’s much better now; I like it and I get a choice”. We saw people were offered frequent drinks throughout the day. Staff spoken with were aware of risks associated with choking due to conditions such as epilepsy or dysphagia. We saw that they were vigilant when supporting people at mealtimes. The cook had information about people’s dietary needs such as diabetes, celiac and soft diets. People had regular opportunities to eat out, one person  said, “I can go out for lunch or a pub meal, I like that”. Some people had input from speech and language therapists [SALT] and dieticians to support them with their nutritional needs. There was guidance available for staff about people’s nutritional requirements and we saw this was followed consistently. Where a risk was evident people’s weight was monitored and records reflected this was monitored.  We saw people had access to a range of health professionals such as community learning disability nurses, psychiatrist, dentist, opticians and GP. We saw people were supported to access specialist health practitioners for their complex needs such as the epilepsy nurse. A person told us, “I see the doctor and other people who look after me”. Staff we spoke with were aware of people’s health needs and the preventative steps needed to promote people’s well-being. We saw that where people’s health deteriorated staff followed this up with relevant professionals. Hospital passports were being developed. This reflected the person’s health needs, management, their medicines and key health contacts. These are used to promote consistency for the person when using health services. Relatives told us they had no concerns about the management of people’s health needs and that they were always kept informed of any concerns.  8 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "	  	"  People we spoke with told us that they were happy at the home. One person told us, ""I love it here, staff are nice to me”. All of the relatives we spoke with were complimentary about the caring attitude of staff. One relative told us, ""[Persons name] is cared for brilliantly; the staff are really lovely with [persons name]”. Another relative told us, “There has been a vast improvement; [persons name] is happy, communicates much better, loves the staff, I am more than happy”.  We observed that there was a high level of engagement and interaction with people which was warm and inclusive and involved everyone having a say about their day. For example we heard staff speaking with people and seeing what they wanted to do and supporting them to do it. Two people went out shopping and another person attended an appointment. One person told us, “The staff are good, they’re friendly and if I want something they try and do it”. We saw people relaxing in the lounge with staff; some people enjoyed conversing with staff, other people we saw enjoyed a more tactile approach; holding staff’s hand or staff stroking their arm. We concluded that staff were caring in their approach to people, they were patient and unrushed and we saw that where people needed one to one support this was carried out in an unobtrusive way.  Staff we spoke with were able to explain people's preferred method of communication and how they would express themselves if they were unhappy, sad, angry or frustrated. We saw there was good detail in people’s plans to guide staff and that staff used this well to interact with people. For example we saw some extremely positive interactions between staff and people they supported. A staff member used gestures and repeated key phases when supporting a person. The person responded with hugs and smiles. The staff member clearly had good insight into how the person communicated their feelings and wishes and this ensured the staff member supported them in the way they wanted.  Staff had a good understanding of people’s personalities and used this well when engaging them. We saw for example they were patient and calm when people became anxious or agitated and knew the best way to comfort them. We saw staff had developed personalised care and support routines with people which took account of their needs. For example a detailed bedtime routine was in place for one person to help them settle and create  9 Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  consistency and a calm approach. We also saw that a detailed plan was in place for another person, recognising their heightened agitation in the morning. A staff member told us, “We understand the signs of agitation and try to reduce the level of distress when delivering their care”. We found staff knew how to support people in a caring, person-centred way.  We saw staff understood what mattered to people and how they expressed this. For example we saw one person had their personal objects with them at all times. We saw staff reassured them where these items were. A staff member told us, “These are the person’s ‘comforts’ and are really important to them, we make sure they have them”. This ensured people’s views mattered and that staff listened to them and communicated with them in a way they could understand.  We saw some people had been involved in the recruitment interviews for new staff. One person told us they had enjoyed this. A staff member told us, “It’s important people have a say about who is working with them, I think it builds trust and shows people we are interested in their views”.  The relationships between staff and people receiving support demonstrated that staff knew people well and we saw examples of where staff had responded to people’s needs in a caring and compassionate way. For example staff had spent time with individual people discussing their feelings which showed concern for their wellbeing. One staff member told us, “The person was sad, It’s important to listen to people”. This showed staff had empathy for people and were proactively supporting people to express their views. It also showed staff tried to promote people’s self-esteem because we saw they had helped people to reflect on their achievements.  Some of the people required support with their personal care and people indicated both verbally and with a hand gesture and smile, they were well cared for. People were wearing clothing they liked and had chosen and a person said staff helped them to shave. A relative told us, “[Persons name] needs a lot of support with personal care; staff have listened and acted on this because they are purchasing an electric shaver”. These actions showed staff were promoting people’s dignity and independence.  Our conversations with staff showed they spoke about people in positive terms. Staff told us they had discussed values so that they understood the principles of good care.  Good –––  Is the service caring?  They had a good understanding of the need to promote privacy, respect and dignity and we saw they did this in their daily interactions with people. We saw some very positive responses from staff to protecting people’s dignity. One example showed a staff member instinctively covering a person who had removed their clothing which showed they respected the person’s need to be protected in this way. Another example showed us that staff respected people’s personal space and their possessions. There was clear decision making which resulted in not making judgements about the person’s behaviour.  Staff we spoke with were aware that some people could feel lonely or become isolated in the flats. We observed staff interacted with people and checked their well-being. People told us they spent periods in the main house but  enjoyed the privacy of their flat. They had no concerns about the approach of staff. One person said, “They do care and make sure I am alright. Another person said, “I can talk to them about any worries, they’re good like that”.  People were supported to maintain their independence. One person told us, “I look after my money but staff help me to do it”. We saw staff were attentive when supporting people with their shopping skills. Two people told us how they had their own keys and they locked their room or flat when they went out. We heard from people that they cleaned and tidied their own rooms and took part in shopping and cooking meals. Two people we spoke with confirmed they liked to be independent.  Staff were able to describe to us how they could seek input from advocacy services to represent people’s interests where they were unable to do this for themselves.  10  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  "	  	"  Some people were able to tell us that they were happy with the care and support they received and had been involved in discussing their care. One person said, ""They talked to me about what I want”. Relatives consistently said that they were included in regular discussions about people’s care. One relative said, “I think they are very good at communicating issues, they listen and we decide together what is the best approach”.  Some people were unable to communicate their preferences, wishes and choices but we saw from care plans that attempts had been made to ensure their care plan was personal to them. For example we saw plans contained details about people’s preferred routines. This ensured staff understood how to interpret and understand people’s wishes and support them in the way they wanted. Our discussions with staff showed that they knew people well and understood their needs and preferences. We saw they had used this information to inform people’s care plans so making them more personalised to the person. For example we saw that people’s routines had been recorded so that staff knew how to support people at key times of the day such as getting up or going to bed.  Staff told us some people could put themselves or others at risk of harm if they became anxious. We saw there was a detailed behaviour management plan in place for staff to follow to support one person with their behaviours. All of the staff we spoke with were aware of the behavioural guidelines in place and were able to describe how the person was supported. We saw that specialist advice from external healthcare professionals had been included and followed in order to reduce the person’s anxieties. We saw staff managed and supported the person with their behaviours. The person told us, “I’m happy with the staff, they are very good to me”.  We saw that staff had platforms to regularly review and monitor people's needs. For example staff told us they had an in-depth handover in which they discussed the wellbeing of each person. One member of staff said, ""We share information about people’s needs, any concerns or incidents and staff are delegated to follow this up”. We saw examples where staff had taken action where people’s needs had changed; for example one person had visited the hospital for medical tests. Staff told us that they recorded information about people’s care in their daily  11  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  diaries and we saw each person's activities, their behaviours and communication provided an overall picture of the person's wellbeing. These were being checked by senior staff to see if any changes were needed to people’s care plans. Relatives told us they had attended review meetings and we saw that external professionals contributed to this process. For example we saw a specialist visit the home to review the changing needs of two people on the day we inspected. A staff member told us, “We do involve relevant key professionals to obtain their advice on our care approach”. We saw that this had been done promptly in response to the needs of the two people. Our discussions with senior staff showed they were well informed about the care interventions people needed. We also saw they ‘led by example’ by for instance explaining to staff how to distract/or diffuse situations so that people received a consistent response to their needs.  People were supported to access social activities which they had expressed an interest in. One person told us they attended a weekly evening group which they enjoyed. Another person had been supported to attend a day centre. We saw that where people had an interest in work or education they had been supported to find a work placement. A relative told us, “It’s been great for [person’s name], is growing in confidence, showing more responsibility and developing skills”. We saw that people were engaged in things they enjoyed such as drawing, listening to music, watching DVD’s and playing games. A pool table had been purchased which people told us they enjoyed. One person told us how they liked to care for the chickens in the garden. “I look after them every day”. We saw some people enjoyed activities on their laptops. A sensory room was available where people could relax and enjoy music and visual stimulation. People told us they had frequent trips out for lunch or to the pub. People had enjoyed a variety of social events; trips to the theatre, football matches, social clubs in the community and discos. We saw that there was good evidence that people’s interest and aspirations were being addressed. One person told us, “There’s a lot of things to do and I go out more”.  People we spoke with knew who they could talk to if they had any complaints. One person told us, “If I had any complaints I would tell the staff, but they ask me if everything is alright so if things need doing it would be done then”. Relatives told us they had confidence in the staff and management and would represent their son or daughter if they were unhappy about something. The  Good –––  Is the service responsive?  provider had a complaints procedure in formats people could understand which they had shared with people and their families. A record of how complaints had been addressed and resolved was evident.  People told us they were supported to maintain relationships with people who were important to them.  Relatives told us that they were always made welcome. A relative told us, “Whenever I visit I see the staff are always caring for people, and people are happy”. Another relative told us, “The staff have lovely relationships with people, I’m fully confident this is a great service and the staff are a credit”.  12  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "	  	"  At our last inspection in February 2015 we assessed that the provider had not maintained accurate records related to people’s needs and this had resulted in omissions in some people’s care. We had also found that the well-led section required improvement. The quality monitoring systems at that time had failed to ensure that shortfalls relating to medicine management were identified. There was also a lack of safeguards in place for monitoring and managing people’s health conditions and a risk of people receiving unsafe or inconsistent care because records detailing how people’s risks should be managed were not up to date. The review of accidents and incidents had not been recorded accurately or analysed to ensure appropriate follow up action was taken. We inspected the care records related to people’s care during this inspection and found that improvements had been made and the provider had met the regulation.  We found that the provider had improved their checking processes and audits so that people had their medicines as they were prescribed and that these were administered safely by trained staff. We saw that people’s care plans had been reviewed to ensure that they were current and up-to-date. We found that care plans identified risks to people’s health, welfare and safety and provided guidance to staff as to what they needed to do to support the people. We looked at the monitoring tools in place and saw that staff were using these consistently to monitor their interventions so that any deterioration in people’s health could be identified and acted upon in a timely way. We heard from staff that the improved care records and monitoring tools provided them with the information they needed.  The provider had introduced a new system to analyse the number and type of accidents and incidents. We saw they had reviewed these regularly to identify any patterns or trends with a view to reducing risks. However further improvement was needed to ensure these records reflected how decisions about people’s safety had been reached. For example whether some incidents required reporting to other agencies such as safeguarding. We also saw that staff did not always consistently record their  13  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  Good –––  findings accurately or complete a body map. This is needed to show checks had been made on the person involved in an accident or incident. The registered provider told us after our inspection that they had addressed this.  We found that platforms were in place to help staff share information on a daily basis. A staff member told us, “The handover is much more in-depth so we discuss what actions need to be taken to follow up any issues”. We saw staff were clear about their roles and responsibilities because the provider had implemented a written hand over record. A delegation system was in place so that staff were accountable for actions and tasks to be completed. Senior staff were supported in their leadership roles and had been provided with training to develop their skills for their tasks and responsibilities. One staff said, ""We have more responsibility which is good, we get a lot of support and guidance and I’ve had training so I feel confident in my role”. We saw that regular meetings had taken place at all levels within the organisation to ensure good communication which provided assurance that the service was being well led.  There had been some significant changes to the management of the service. This had included a new registered manager and a deputy manager who were supported by a team of senior care staff. There was a clear leadership structure which we found that staff understood. One staff said, “We have been through some unsettling times but things are so much better now, I feel really well supported”. The provider had also provided administrative support to the home on a daily basis and we heard from senior staff that this had ‘freed up’ their time and improved their capacity to focus on their responsibilities.  All the people we spoke with indicated they knew and liked the registered manager. One person said, ""She’s 100% and things are much better here now”. Relatives told us that stability of management had been their main area of concern. However they all reported there had been significant improvements and that they had confidence in the registered manager and provider. One relative said, “It’s always been a fantastic service for us, the recent changes in management were a worry but I think there has been lots of improvements so I am happy”. Another relative told us, “I am extremely happy and confident with them, they communicate with me, and [name of person] is happy and settled I have peace of mind”. We saw the registered manager was very much part of the staff team and saw she  Good –––  Is the service well-led?  spent time with people who lived at the home. She knew people well and had begun to get to know some of the families via planned meetings to discuss their son or daughter. One relative told us, “She’s very approachable and I have spoken with her”.  Staff had opportunities to contribute to the running of the service people received through regular staff meetings and supervisions. Staff spoke positively about the registered manager who had worked in the service for a few months. One staff member told us, ""There has been a lot of improvements and the new manager has continued this work”. Another staff told us, ""I think the home is well managed; we work well together, communication is better between staff and management and the management team work on the floor so see what is needed”.  Staff understood how they could report any concerns about the care offered by colleagues via the whistle blowing procedures and we saw the provider had taken effective action in response. The provider had increased the opportunities available to staff to be more involved and able to contribute to developments. One staff said, “We have worked hard and people here now have an even better service; more structured care, better social opportunities, it is a nice place for them to live”. A person living there told us, “Lots has changed; staff, managers and we do more stuff”. We saw that staff meetings, handovers and training had been provided to staff.  The provider had visited the home regularly and taken a proactive approach to monitoring and checking all aspects of the service provision. For example we saw he talked with people, staff and families to obtain their feedback. We saw  he carried out checks on records, monitoring tools and the environment. A written record of the findings of these checks was available. The registered manager confirmed any actions needed as a result of the provider’s visits were addressed. The provider told us, “I am much more actively involved and like to check that the tasks we identify are addressed, I am very confident our systems now are robust”. We saw documentary evidence that spot checks had also been carried out by the registered manager during various points of the night to ensure care was being delivered appropriately.  We found that the provider and registered manager’s systems ensured they had a good oversight of the home. This had resulted in a number of improvements for the benefit of people who lived there. For example people’s safety was reviewed, people’s goals and aspirations were being addressed and there was evidence of increased social activities and opportunities. The layout of the lounge and dining areas had been altered and we saw this provided a much calmer environment in which people could relax. The provider had reviewed staff's training needs and we saw they had undertaken additional specialist training to meet people’s complex needs effectively. They had employed a new cook and people reported that the meals were ‘lovely’ and that the choice of meals had improved. We saw surveys had been used to obtain people’s views. Feedback from people and their relatives about the quality of the service was positive. We found that the provider had implemented actions identified as needed by us [Care Quality Commission] and the local authority who had also informed us that improvements had been noted.  14  Oakleigh Lodge Inspection report 19/02/2016  "

This was an unannounced inspection. Our last inspection  took place on 12 January 2017. At that inspection, we identified a number of Regulatory breaches and we  told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure people consistently received care that was safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led. The service was rated as 'inadequate' and remained under special  measures.   Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months.  The expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made  significant improvements within this timeframe.   If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any  key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of  preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve. This service will continue to be kept  under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another  inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is  still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from  operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their  registration.   For adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  As a result of previous enforcement action, a condition was placed on the provider's registration with us that prevented them from admitting and re-admitting people to the service without our authorisation. This  condition was made to promote people's safety and remains in place. This condition has been breached by  the provider since our last inspection and we are taking action to address this.  The service is registered to provide accommodation and personal care for up to 22 people. People who use  the service may have a physical disability and/or mental health needs, such as dementia. At the time of our  inspection nine people were using the service. However, one of these people was in hospital as a result of a  safety incident that had occurred at the service.  There was a registered manager at the home. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the  Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act   2 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  and associated Regulations about how the service is run.   At this inspection, we identified a number of continued and new Regulatory breaches. The overall rating for  this service remains 'Inadequate' and the service therefore remains in 'Special measures' whilst we continue  our enforcement action.   We found that the provider continued to have ineffective systems in place to assess, monitor and improve  the quality of care. This meant that poor care was not being identified and rectified by the registered  manager or provider.   A notifiable safety incident had not been reported to us, which meant that we could not accurately monitor  safety at the service.   Risks to people's health, safety and wellbeing were still not always assessed, planned for, managed and  reviewed to promote people's safety.   Safe recruitment systems were still not in place to ensure staff were of suitable character to work with the  people who used the service.   Safety incidents were not always analysed and responded to effectively and promptly, which meant the risk  of further incidents was not always reduced.   Medicines were not always managed safely.  Some people told us they still experienced occasional delays in receiving the care and support they  required. Staffing levels were not consistently reviewed to ensure safe staffing levels were maintained.   We were still not assured that people's health needs were consistently monitored and advice from health  care professionals was not always followed to promote people's health, safety and wellbeing.   Accurate records were not maintained to show staff had received the training they needed to meet people's  needs and keep people safe. Staff reported that they had not received all the training they required.  An effective complaints system was not in place to ensure complaints were recorded and managed  appropriately and promptly.   Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) requests were made when restrictions were placed on people.  However, these were not always completed in line with the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). People's  capacity to consent to their care was not regularly assessed and reviewed in line with the MCA.   Some improvements had been made in relation to people's receiving care that met their individual care  preferences. However, further improvements were needed to ensure people could access activities that  were meaningful and therapeutic to them.   Although people were involved in the initial planning of their care, they were not involved in regular reviews  of their care to ensure their care preferences had not changed. This meant people were at risk of receiving  care that did not meet their changing preferences.   People could choose the foods they ate, but detailed information about people's specialist dietary needs   3 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  was not always readily accessible to ensure consistent care.   Some people spoke fondly about the staff and at times, we observed some positive interactions between  staff and people. However, we found that people were not consistently treated in a dignified manner.   People were supported to make day to day choices about their care and the choices people made were  respected. People's right to privacy was promoted.   Staff knew how to identify and report incidents of potential abuse and neglect.    The provider was now displaying their inspection rating on line as required.  4 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  Inadequate    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not safe. Risks to people's health, safety and  wellbeing were still not always assessed, planned for, managed  and reviewed to promote people's safety.   Effective systems were still not in place to ensure staff were  suitable to work with the people who used the service.    Medicines were not always administered safely.  Some people told us they still experienced occasional delays in  receiving the care and support they required. Staffing levels were  not consistently reviewed to ensure safe staffing levels were  maintained.   Staff were trained to identify incidents of potential or alleged  abuse.  	  Inadequate    The service was not effective. People's health needs were not  effectively monitored and managed and professional advice was  not always sought or followed to promote people's health, safety and wellbeing.   The requirements of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 were not  always followed to ensure people's ability to consent to their  care was assessed and reviewed.   Staff did not always have the knowledge and skills needed to  meet people's needs effectively and safely.  People could choose the foods they ate, but detailed information about people's specialist dietary needs was not always readily  accessible to ensure consistent care.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not consistently caring. People's dignity was not  always promoted.  People were supported to make day to day choices about their   5 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  care and the choices people made were respected.   People were supported by staff who knew their likes and dislikes  and people told us the staff were kind and caring.  People could access private areas of the home when they wished to do so.  	  The service was not responsive. People were not always  supported to participate in social and leisure based activities  that were meaningful or therapeutic to them.  An effective system was not in place to ensure all complaints  were recorded and managed to improve people's care  experiences.   People were involved in the initial planning of their care.  However, they were not involved in reviewing their care needs. As a result, people were at risk of receiving unsuitable care as their  care preferences changed.  Inadequate    	  Inadequate    The service was not well led. The registered manager and  provider did not have effective systems in place to consistently  assess, monitor and improve the quality of care.   Effective systems were not in place to respond to themes relating to safety incidents, so prompt action was not always taken to  reduce the risk of further harm occurring.   The registered manager and provider did not always report  notifiable incidents to us as required.  6 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017     Ashview House Residential  Care Home  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider was meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  We undertook an unannounced inspection of Ashview House Residential Care Home on 4 September 2017.  We inspected the service against the five questions we ask about services: is the service safe, effective,  caring, responsive and well-led? Our inspection team consisted of two inspectors.   Before the inspection, the provider completed a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks  the provider to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements  they plan to make. We used this information to formulate our inspection plan.  We checked the information we held about the service and provider. This included the statutory  notifications that the provider had sent us. A statutory notification is information about important events  which the provider is required to send us by law. We also reviewed the information we had received from the public and the local authority. This included complaints about the service and monitoring visits. We used  this information to formulate our inspection plan.   We spoke with five people who used the service, six visiting relatives, six members of care staff, the  registered manager and the provider. We did this to gain people's views about the care and to check that  standards of care were being met.   We observed how the staff interacted with people in communal areas and we looked at the care records of  seven people who used the service, to see if their records were accurate and up to date. We also looked at  records relating to the management of the service. These included staff files, rotas and quality assurance   7 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  records.  8 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure people consistently  received their care in a safe manner. This was a breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we found that these improvements had not  been made and people remained at risk of harm to their health, safety and wellbeing.  The risks associated with people's behaviours that challenged, such as aggression were still not always  assessed and planned for. For example, one person's care record showed they had been aggressive towards  staff on five occasions in the ten days leading up to our inspection. This person had at times also displayed  aggressive behaviour towards people who used, visited and worked at the service. These incidents of  aggression had not triggered a re-assessment of the risk this behaviour posed to people and no plans were  in place that contained information to guide staff on how to manage this behaviour when it occurred. This  lack of guidance meant staff were not equipped to manage this person's behaviour in a safe and consistent  manner, as the staff we spoke with gave us different accounts of how they would respond to this person's  aggression. This placed people who used, visited and worked at the service at risk of harm to their health,  safety and wellbeing.  We found that action was still not always taken to reduce the risk of people sustaining injuries from falling.  For example, one person told us they had fallen recently and they showed us the injury they had sustained.  An incident form we viewed confirmed this person had suffered an unwitnessed fall two days before our  inspection. This fall had not triggered a review of the person's mobility needs or risk of falling again. This  meant prompt action had not been taken to assess and manage this person's risk of sustaining further  injuries from falling.   We found that people's risk of skin damage was still not always being assessed and managed in a safe  manner. One person's care plan stated they needed to use a specialist cushion and be supported to  regularly change their position. However, their daily care records that showed the support they received  from staff on a daily basis on occasion, referred to specialist boots that were used to protect their heels from skin damage. We saw that this person was not wearing these boots during our inspection, so we asked two  staff members if these were required as they were not included in the person's care plan. One staff member  told us that the person wore these boots sometimes and the other staff member told us they knew nothing  about this person needing boots. This meant we could not be assured that this person's risk of skin damage  was being planned for and managed in a safe manner as they were receiving variable skin care from  different staff.   Most people who used the service had their medicines from a monitored dosage system where their  medicines came in their prescribed doses direct from a pharmacy. We found that where this system was  used, people's medicines were administered safely. However, safe systems were not always in place to  ensure people received their other medicines consistently and safely. We found that medicines were not  always given in accordance with people's 'as required' protocols and the manufacturer's guidance. One  person had received one of their 'as required' medicines for a period of 14 consecutive days, despite their   9 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  protocol and the manufacturer's guidance stating the medicine should only be administered for five  consecutive days. A staff member told us the person's doctor was aware of this, but the staff member was  unable to show us a record of that confirmed this had been discussed and agreed by a doctor. This meant  we could not be assured that this person had received their 'as required' medicine safely. We also found  inaccuracies in the numbers of medicines in stock and the numbers of medicines recorded on another  person's medicines administration records. These inaccuracies meant that person could not be assured that they had received their blood thinning medicines as prescribed, placing them at potential risk of blood clots  and/or bleeding.   The above evidence demonstrates that effective systems were not in place to ensure people consistently  received their care in a safe manner. This was a continued breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social  Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.    At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure that staff were  suitable to work at the service. This was a breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we saw that some improvements had been made, but further improvements were required. We saw that references and criminal history checks were  requested to ascertain if staff were of suitable character to work at the service. However, the references in  two of the four staff members' files we looked at were not appropriate as these employment references had  been sought from staff member's colleagues rather than their managers. This meant we could not be  assured that these references were an accurate reflection of their suitability to work at the service as work  colleagues would not have access to the information about the referee in terms of their previous  competence, skills and overall suitability for the role. This was a continued breach of Regulation 19 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.    At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure the staff were  effectively deployed to promote people's safety and ensure people's needs were consistently met in a timely manner. This was a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we saw that some improvements had been made, but further  improvements were still required to ensure staffing levels were promptly reviewed as and when people's  needs changed.   People and their relatives told us that staff were now mostly always present in communal areas to promote  people's safety. One relative said, ""I've noticed the staff are in the lounge more now doing paperwork"".  However, we received mixed feedback from people about the timeliness of the staff in responding to their  need to access the toilet. One person said, ""I can go to the toilet most times when I ask now"". Another  person said, ""They don't always take notice of me when I want the toilet"". This meant that some people  continued to experience occasional delays in receiving the care and support they needed.  Some of the staff we spoke with us told us that two people who used the service required one to one care  and support at times due to their behaviours that challenged and the risks these posed to themselves and  other people. Staff told us that despite the changes in these people's needs, no changes had been made to  the staffing levels. One staff member said, ""If [person who used the service] is here, they take up so much  time"". Another staff member said, ""There's only three staff and [person who used the service] needs one to  one. Staffing needs to be improved"". We asked the registered manager to show us the dependency tool they  used to assess the current staffing levels. The registered manager did not have an up to date version of this  tool at the time of our inspection. However, they sent us an updated version the day after the inspection  which supported the staffing levels that were in place at the time of the inspection. This showed that  although the provider assured us safe staffing levels were maintained, the tool used to ascertain staffing   10 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  levels was not kept up to date. This meant there was a risk that safe staffing levels may not be consistently  maintained.      At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure incidents of alleged  abuse and neglect were reported to the appropriate agencies. This was a breach of Regulation 13 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we saw  improvements had been made. Staff told us how they would identify, record and report potential abuse and  records showed that staff had completed training in this area of care. No incidents of alleged abuse had  been identified or recorded by staff since our last inspection; therefore we were unable to confirm that the  reporting systems in place were fully effective. We will continue to monitor the provider's compliance in this  area of care.  11 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure that effective systems  were in place to ensure people's health, safety and wellbeing needs were monitored and managed in a safe  and effective manner. This was an additional breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People told us and care records showed that they were supported to see health care professionals when  they were unwell. For example, one person told us they were supported to access a district nurse at times in  relation to their skincare needs. However, we found that the advice of health care professionals was not  always followed to promote people's health, safety and wellbeing. For example, one person's care records  showed that on two occasions since May 2017, a community psychiatric nurse had asked staff to record a  person's behaviours that challenged on an ABC chart. An ABC chart is a tool used to record people's  behaviours and their triggers and consequences. This tool can help professionals to assess and monitor  people's health and wellbeing. We found that ABC charts were not being used for this person despite their  care records showing that they regularly displayed behaviours that challenged, such as aggression and  restlessness. This meant effective systems were not in place to ensure professional advice was followed. This placed people at continued risk of harm to their health, safety and wellbeing.   Care records showed that some health monitoring was completed. For example, people's weights were  monitored to identify and act upon any changes. However, we found that the systems in place to monitor  people's diabetic needs were still not effective. For example, one person's care plan stated their blood  sugars needed to be monitored regularly. The plan did not inform staff how often the testing should occur,  but staff told us this testing needed to be completed three times a day. This person's blood sugar records  contained gaps which showed their blood sugars were not always monitored three times a day. This placed  the person at risk of harm to their health, safety and wellbeing as staff were not able to show that they were  consistently monitoring this person's blood sugar levels to identify and act upon any changes.   We also found that the information required to enable staff to effectively monitor people's diabetes was not  available in the care records. We looked at the care records for two people who lived with diabetes.  Information was available to staff to inform them of the symptoms of high and low blood sugars and what  they should do in these circumstances. However, no record of people's expected safe blood sugar levels  were recorded. When we spoke with staff about people's safe/expected levels we received different answers. This meant staff did not know what blood sugar readings would indicate that an individual's blood sugars  were too low or too high for them. One person's recorded blood sugar readings were frequently significantly  higher than the recommended safe range set by NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence).  This placed them at risk of long term damage to their health. Care records also contained limited evidence  to show that action was taken when a high reading was obtained. For example, on 17 recent occasions the  person's blood sugar levels were recorded as at least double the recommended level. Care records only  showed that action was taken or professional advice was sought on four of these 17 occasions. This meant  we could not be assured that the long term risks of significantly high blood sugar readings were being  addressed.   12 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  When people suffered skin injuries, such as skin tears, pressure ulcers or bruising; body maps were not  always used to record the details of the injury. For example one person's care records contained information about three recent injuries they had sustained from three recent falls. These three injuries had not been  recorded on body maps. This meant that the person's injuries could not be monitored for changes as the  specific details of the site, size and appearance of these injuries were not clearly recorded.   The above evidence shows that effective systems were not in place to ensure people's health, safety and  wellbeing needs were monitored and managed in a safe and effective manner. This was an additional and  continued breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  At our last two inspections, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure effective  systems were in place to gain and review people's ability to consent to their care. At our last inspection, we  judged that this was an area for improvement, rather than a breach of Regulation. At this inspection, we  found that improvements had not been made. The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal  framework for making particular decisions on behalf of people who may lack the mental capacity to do so  for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible people make their own decisions and are helped to  do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to make particular decisions, any made on their behalf  must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as possible.   We found that people's ability to consent to their care was not reviewed in response to changes in their  ability to consent to their care. For example, one person's mental capacity to consent to their care at  Ashview had been completed prior to their admission to the service. This assessment judged that the person had capacity to make this decision. However, their consent to care form had been signed seven months  later by their next of kin with no reference to the person being involved in that decision. Staff confirmed that  this person was frequently confused due to their medical condition, which made their capacity to consent to their care variable. This meant the person's capacity to consent to their care had not been formally reviewed and consent to care was not sought in line with the MCA.   Consent to the use of equipment forms were also in place that had been signed by people who used the  service. These forms did not specify the exact equipment the people had consented to, so we were not able  to ascertain that people had consented to the specific equipment that they were using.   At our last three inspections, we found that the requirements of the MCA and Deprivation of Liberty  Safeguards (DoLS) were not consistently met. This meant people could not be assured that they were being  deprived of their liberty in a lawful manner. This was a breach of Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care  Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we found that some improvements had  been made. The provider was no longer in breach of this specific Regulation, but further improvements were still required.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and hospitals are  called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We saw some appropriate DoLS referrals had been  made and conditions set within people's authorised DoLS were met. However, we identified one person  whose capacity to consent to their care had not been assessed to show they were unable to consent to this  part of their care. The DoLS only apply once a person has been deemed to not have the mental capacity to  consent to the restrictions placed upon them.   The above evidence shows that effective systems were not in place to assess, record and review people's   13 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  ability to consent to their care and the requirements of the MCA were not always followed. This was a new  breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  At our last inspection, we found that effective systems were not in place to ensure staff were suitably skilled  to meet people's needs in a safe and effective manner. This was a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we were unable to ascertain  if improvements had been made as accurate training records were not maintained and staff reported some  gaps in training.  We asked to see staff training records. However, these had not been maintained and updated at the time of  our inspection. Therefore newly appointed staffs' training records were not recorded. An updated copy of  the staffs' training was sent to us after our inspection. We looked at the training records for three staff who  had recently started to work at the service. Their training records showed they had received training in areas  such as safeguarding, moving and handling and behaviour that challenged. However, the training dates  significantly preceded their employment at the service and their staff files did not contain evidence to  support they had completed all the training recorded on the training matrix in the past. This meant we could not be assured that these staff members had completed these trainings and gained the skills required to  support people safely.   Some staff told us that they would benefit from training/more training in diabetes and behaviours that  challenge. For example, one staff member told us, ""I've asked for diabetes training"" and they confirmed they  had not yet received this training. When we spoke with this staff member about a person's diabetic needs,  the information they gave us did not match diabetes best practice guidance. However, this staff member's  training records showed they had completed this training. This meant that their training records may have  been inaccurate or the training they had received had not been effective.    The above evidence shows that effective systems were still not in place to ensure staff were suitably skilled  to meet people's needs in a safe and effective manner. This was a continued breach of Regulation 18 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  At our last inspection, people told us and we saw that their food and dining preferences were not always  met. This was a breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we saw that improvements had been made.   People told us and we saw that they were now offered a choice of meals and their food preferences were  met. However, some people and their relatives told us this was a very recent change that they hoped would  continue to remain in place. One person said, ""The food has been a lot better this week, there have been  various menus"". A relative said, ""Up until last week [person who used the service] used to complain about  the food, there's never usually a choice"".  People also told us that their dining experience had improved. For example, one person told us they had  requested music to be played at mealtimes and they confirmed and we saw that music was now being  played. We saw also that people's preferences as to where they wished to eat their meals was now  respected and met.   People and their relatives told us that specialist dietary needs were met. However, the systems in place to  ensure all staff followed recommendations in relation to this were not fully effective. This was because  information about people's specialist dietary needs was not always readily accessible for the staff to refer to  and follow. This meant there was a risk that people's specialist dietary needs may not be consistently met.  14 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure people were  consistently treated with dignity and respect. This was not identified as a breach of Regulation. At this  inspection, we found that some improvements had been made. For example, staff were recording care  interventions using dignified language. However, further improvements were still required to ensure that  people's dignity was consistently promoted. People told us they were treated with dignity. For example, one  person said, ""They don't rush me, they're really good"". However, we saw that some care interactions were  completed in an undignified manner. For example, we saw that's people's medicines were not always given  in a manner that promoted people's dignity as eye drops were administered to people during mealtimes in  front of other people who were eating their meals. This meant that improvements were needed to ensure  people's dignity was consistently promoted.    People and their relatives told us that the staff were kind and caring. Comments from people included;  ""Whatever I ask, they do. They are not rude"" and, ""The staff are nice"". Comments from relatives included;  ""The carers do actually care"" and, ""I've never come across a carer that's given me cause for concern"".  People told us that the staff knew their likes, dislikes and care preferences well. For example, one person  told us that since care staff had been covering the cooking tasks in the absence of the cook, they were  getting foods that they enjoyed as the staff knew their likes and dislikes well. They said, ""It's been really good this week"".  We also saw that staff knew people well as we heard them talking to people about their  interests. For example, we heard one staff member talk to a person about Frank Sinatra which the person  confirmed was one of their musical preferences.   We saw that some people were offered choices about their day to day care. For example, we saw one person was given a choice of mugs to drink their cup of tea from. We also saw that the choices people made in  relation to their day to day care were respected. For example, when a person asked for their juice to be  poured into a glass rather than a plastic beaker, a member of staff respected this choice and poured the  juice into a glass as requested.   People told us and we saw they could access private areas of the home when they wished to do so. For  example, we saw staff offer and support a person to access a private room to meet with their visitor.  15 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our last four inspections, we found that improvements were required to ensure care was consistently  provided in accordance with people's preferences and individual needs. This was an additional breach of  Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this  inspection, we found some improvements had been made, but further improvements were still required.   People told us they could now bathe when they wished to do so. Comments from people included; ""I have a  bath twice a week now"" and, ""I have a bath when I want one"". However, people and their relatives reported a reduction in the support available to ensure people were engaged in activities that met their leisure and  social based needs and interests. We asked people how they spent their time at Ashview. Comments from  people included; ""I read and watch TV, there's not a lot you can do here is there?"" and, ""[We do] nothing  really, we used to do more"". Relatives we spoke with also commented on the change in activity provision.  One relative said, ""There's no activities worker anymore"" and, ""The staff play dominoes with [person who  used the service] but most either watch TV or are asleep"". Another relative said, ""There doesn't seem to be  anything going on and [person who used the service] never goes out now"". Staff told us they were unable to  support everyone to meet their activity preferences as some people who used the service needed a higher  level of support from them to promote their safety. This meant some people didn't receive the support they  needed to engage in activities that were meaningful and therapeutic to them. This was a continued breach  of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  At our last inspection, we told the provider that improvements were needed to ensure that concerns and  complaints were addressed promptly. This was not identified as a breach of Regulation. At this inspection,  we found that improvements were still needed to ensure an effective system was in place to record and  respond to complaints.   People and their relatives gave us mixed feedback about how complaints were managed. Positive  comments included; ""Some things I raise are addressed"" and, ""I had a word with [staff member] the other  week about food and it's altered now"". Other comments included; ""What [the registered manager] tells you  and what he does are two different things"" and, ""I'm fed up of keeping saying the same things"". An example  of a common complaint raised by this relative related to problems with the laundering of clothes. We asked  the registered manager to see their complaints records. However, the registered manager did not know  where this information was located. We asked for this information to be sent to us and following our  inspection, we were sent a brief summary of the complaints received. This information did not include the  initial recording of the complaints received and the formal responses sent to the complainants. This meant  we could not identify if these complaints had been managed appropriately. Concerns and complaints that  people's relatives told us they had raised, such as complaints about laundry and food were also not  included in the complaints summary sheet sent to us. This meant that some complaints were not being  recorded and/or acted upon as required. Not having an effective system to record and handle complaints is  a breach of Regulation 16 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Care records showed that people had been involved in some elements of care planning. For example, care   16 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  records contained information about people's likes, dislikes and life histories. However, people were not  actively involved in the review of their care. This meant there was a risk that as people's preferences  changes, staff would not be aware of this and people were at risk of receiving care that did not consistently  reflect their care preferences.  17 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our last two inspections, we found that improvements were needed to ensure the home was well-led. At  our last inspection, this was identified as a breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we found the required improvements had not  been made. This placed people at risk of ongoing harm to their health, safety and wellbeing.  People and their relatives described the registered manager as, ""Warm and welcoming"" and, ""Kind"".  However, people and their relatives also told us that they did not always have confidence in the registered  manager's and provider's ability to make and sustain improvements to the quality of care. Comments  included; ""I get the impression from the staff that it's not the best run home"", ""The staff are nice, but they  need leading"", ""Some things seem to have gone better, but I still feel uneasy"" and, ""It could be really nice  and really good. I'm hoping it can be turned around, but I have my doubts"". This showed that some people  and their relatives had identified that the service was not well-led.   Effective systems were not in place to ensure the quality of care was effectively assessed and monitored to  make improvements. The information contained in people's care records was not being effectively  monitored or analysed by the registered manager or provider to ensure the information contained within  them was accurate and up to date. For example, we found that one of the two care plan audits completed  since our last inspection had not identified that the person did not have an up to date mental capacity  assessment in relation to their ability to consent to the restrictions placed upon on them and it had not  identified that a plan to guide staff how to manage their behaviours that challenged was not in place. This  placed people at risk of harm and showed that effective systems were not in place to ensure people's care  records were accurate, up to date and complete.  Effective systems were not in place to ensure people's care needs were being managed effectively. For  example, the registered manager and provider had not identified that people's diabetic needs were being  effectively planned for or managed in a safe manner as gaps in one person's blood sugar monitoring had  not been identified and there was no evidence to show that staff were managing this person's variable and  potentially unsafe blood sugar readings. This meant staff did not have access to the information they  needed to manage people's health needs in a safe and effective manner. As a result of this, people were at  risk of receiving unsafe and inconsistent care.  Safety incidents were not promptly analysed to ensure action could be taken to prevent further incidents  from occurring. For example, the incident book contained completed forms in relation to one person's falls  from a period of time covering up to 49 days prior to our inspection. This meant the registered manager had  not reviewed these incidents during this time to identify if action was required to ensure this person's safety.  Incident forms relating to this person showed they had fallen on four occasions during this time. During this  time period two visiting health care professionals had recommended that this person receive one to one  supervision from staff to ensure their safety. However, no action had been taken to protect this person from  the risk of falling by following the professionals' advice as no request for one to one funding was made and  no one to one support was put into place. This showed that a prompt and proactive response to address   18 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  risk had not been taken to ensure this person's safety.   We found that the provider was not following the actions listed on the action plan that they submitted to us  after our last inspection. For example, one of the actions on this plan stated, 'Ensure there is evidence of  manager's daily walk around with associated action plans on findings'. Management records showed  evidence of three 'walkabout' audits since our last inspection. The last one was dated April 2017. This meant the registered manager and provider were not completing these 'daily' quality checks as planned. We also  found that information recorded by the registered manager and provider in their completed Provider  Information Return (PIR) was not always completed as planned. For example, the PIR stated, 'Service users  are regularly involved in designing what activities they would like for the coming week'. However, people  told us they were not supported to participate in activities that met their leisure and social preferences and  no activities worker was in post to support people to engage in activities that were meaningful to them. This  meant the registered manager and provider did not always make the improvements or provide the quality of care that they stated they would provide.   The registered manager and provider had not maintained accurate records relating to the management of  the service. For example, an accurate staff training list was not maintained as the one shown to us during  the inspection did not have some staff listed on it. This was also an action listed on the provider's action  plan submitted to us after our last inspection which stated, 'Ensure training matrix is current at all times'.  The registered manager and provider did not know where complaints records were located when we asked  for them. This meant effective systems were not in place to ensure records relating to the management of  the service were accurate, up to date and readily available.   In July 2017, the provider contacted us to inform us that they had hired an external consultant to help them  to assess, monitor and improve the quality of care at Ashview and the other home's owned by the provider.  We saw no evidence to show this action had led to any improvements in quality at the service at the time of  our inspection.   The above evidence shows effective systems were not in place to assess, monitor and improve the quality of  care and manage risks to people's health and wellbeing. This was a continued breach of Regulation 17 of  the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  We found that the registered manager and provider had not reported a notifiable incident of a serious injury  to us as required under our registration Regulations. This meant we did not have access to important  intelligence to help us to monitor safety at this service. This was a breach of Regulation 18 of the Care  Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009.  In April 2017, the provider was found to be in breach of a condition of their registration with us. A person was readmitted to the service without CQC authorisation. This is an offence under Section 33 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008.   At our last inspection, we found that the provider was not displaying their rating on their website as  required. This was a breach of Regulation 20a of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. At this inspection, we found that the rating was now being displayed as required.  19 Ashview House Residential Care Home Inspection report 09 November 2017  "

However, the provider had placed a restriction on the service provision and there were  43 people living at the service on the day of inspection.   We carried out an unannounced comprehensive inspection of the service on the 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 July  2017. Previously, the service had been inspected in November 2016 and received an overall rating of requires improvement.  The overall rating for this service is 'Inadequate' and the service is therefore in 'Special measures'. Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to propose to cancel  the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months. The expectation is that  providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant improvements within this time frame. If not enough improvement is made within this time frame so that there is still a rating of  inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to  begin the process of preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their  registration or to varying the terms of this registration.  This service will continue to be kept under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement  action. Where necessary, another inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take  action to prevent the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to  varying the terms of their registration.  For adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures. The Care Quality  Commission is now considering the appropriate regulatory response to resolve the problems we found  during our inspection.   The service did not have a Registered manager. It is a requirement of the service's registration with the Care  Quality Commission that there is a registered manager in place. A registered manager is a person who has   2 Whittingham House 	" 07 February 2018  registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are  'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health  and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  There were no systems in place to ensure that staff were deployed in a way which met people's changing  needs and circumstances. This meant that staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs  were met and people were put at potential risk of harm.  Care records, plans, and assessments were very generic and did not take account of people's individual  needs effectively. Information had not always been recorded or assessed to demonstrate how the service  was going to mitigate any risks to people's safety. People were at risk as the processes in place to safeguard  people from potential incidents remained inadequate.   Staff training had not been embedded in everyday practice. Staff training was out of date in some cases and  their competency to perform their duties had not been reviewed. Staff did not receive regular supervision  and support, which meant that staff lacked the skills and support to perform their roles effectively.   Improvements were required to the way in which the service assessed people's capacity to make decisions  and how they supported people to make choices. People's dining experience was not always positive. The  service needed to improve the way mealtimes were organised and how choices were offered to people,  including offering clear support and explanations to people which choices were being served.  Some staff were not knowledgeable of people's individual care needs nor did they have knowledge of their  histories and backgrounds so as to enable them to deliver personalised care in all instances. People's care  was not always planned and assessed to ensure their safety and welfare. Individual's preferences relating to  their diet had not been considered. Where there had been efforts made to provide people with specific care  this was not being adhered to. People did not always receive care in a person centered way because the  deployment of staff meant the  approach was mainly task and routine focused.  Roles and responsibilities were unclear and staff were unsure what they were accountable for. The culture of the service was not a positive one and staff lacked time, knowledge and understanding. Quality assurance  systems and processes, which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service were not effective  or established. Support and resources needed to run the service were not available and the provider was  not operating the service in line with their own philosophy of care. The lack of good quality governance had  impacted on the delivery of safe and effective care.  There was a complaints procedure in place. Relatives told us that they would speak with the manager if they had any concerns or complaints, however some relatives were unsure if they would be listened to. There  was not a comprehensive system in place to demonstrate that lessons were learnt from past concerns and  complaints or that formal analysis of concerns and complaints had been undertaken.   There was thorough recruitment procedures in place to ensure staff were suitable to work with vulnerable  adults. This was carried out by the head office. Medications were managed safely and as needed.  3 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Is the service safe?  The service was not safe.  Staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs  were met and people were put at potential risk of harm.  Care records, plans and assessments were very generic and did  not take account of people's individual needs effectively..   Medicines were stored and disposed safely and medication  management was safe.  Is the service effective?  The service was not effective.  Staff did not have a structured opportunity to discuss their  practice and development to ensure that they continued to  deliver care effectively to people.  Improvements were required to ensure that staff's training was  effective and good practice was embedded through their  everyday practices with people who used the service.  The dining experience for people was variable and not always  appropriate to meet people's individual nutritional needs.  Is the service caring?  The service was not always caring.  Not all care provided was person centred, caring and kind.  People and those acting on their behalf were not always involved in the planning of their care.  People were not always treated with dignity and respect.  Is the service responsive?  The service was not responsive to people's needs.  4 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate    Inadequate    Requires Improvement    Inadequate    People were not always engaged in meaningful activities and  supported to pursue pastimes that interested them, particularly  for people living with dementia.

Inadequate    5 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018     Whittingham House  Detailed findings  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the registered manager was meeting  the legal requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the  overall quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on the 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 July 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was  undertaken by two inspectors and a pharmacist inspector.  We reviewed other information that we held about the service such as notifications. These are the events  happening in the service that the registered manager is required to tell us about. We used this information to plan what areas we were going to focus on during our inspection.  As part of the inspection we spoke with seven people who used the service, five relatives and 10 members of  care staff, deputy manager, care team manager and care supervisor. We also spoke with the local authority's contracts and social work team.  Some people were unable to communicate with us verbally to tell us about the quality of the service  provided and how they were cared for by staff. We therefore used observations, speaking with staff, and  relatives, reviewing care records and other information to help us assess how people's care needs were  being met. We spent time observing care in the communal areas and used the Short Observational  Framework for Inspection (SOFI). SOFI is a way of observing care to help us understand the experience of  people who could not talk with us.  As part of this inspection we reviewed 10 people's care records. We looked at the recruitment and support  records for five members of staff. We reviewed other records such as medicines management, complaints  and compliments information, quality monitoring, audit information and maintenance records.  6 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  Is the service safe?  Our findings    During and prior to our inspection, we had concerns about the amount of staff available to meet people's  care and support needs. People's views on staffing levels and how they were deployed  were mixed. One  person informed us, ""I am no longer able to walk so I need support to get to the lounge; however I opt to  stay in my room as I have to wait about an hour for staff to come and help me."" Relatives expressed  concerns that when they have visited, they had not been able to find a member of staff to support or assist  their relative.  Staff we spoke with told us they felt there were not enough of them to meet the needs of people in a timely  and safe manner. One staff member informed us, ""In the morning and night time we can be rushed as we  trying to either get everyone up for breakfast or ready for bed."" Although some staff told us that staffing  levels were acceptable and they could meet people's day to day needs, others informed us staffing levels  were inadequate to meet people's needs and that this could be stressful especially at busy period of the day.  On the ground floor, we found staff to be alert to any concerns or dangers resulting from people's choices,  being distressed or anxious, however on the first floor despite staff being alert to people's needs, staff were  rushed and task focused and often there was a lack of presence.   Our observations on the first day of the inspection showed that although there were staff on duty, there were five people sitting in the back dining room/lounge with one person who was regularly calling out for help.  During this time, no staff came into the lounge to ascertain why the person was distressed. This was due to  the members of staff supporting people with their care needs elsewhere.  This appeared to upset other  people sitting in the lounge. Due to the amount of distress that was being shown by this person.   The care supervisor informed us that they used the resident forum tool to determine people's dependencies  and the required staffing levels. The care supervisor informed us during the inspection that they felt the  current dependency tool used did not give a true reflection of people's current care needs. The care  supervisor had recently completed 20 Barthel dependency assessments and found that 17/20 of the  completed assessments reflected that the people's needs were higher than being currently assessed. There  was no systems in place to ensure that staff were deployed in a way which met people's changing needs and circumstances. This meant that staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs were met  and people were put at potential risk of harm.   7 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  After the inspection, we wrote to the provider raising our concerns around staffing levels in the home. The  provider responded advising that staffing levels would be increased to ensure that people's needs were  being met adequately. Although this was encouraging, we judged the service to be in breach of regulation  due to the poor care outcomes people had experienced and because this had already been highlighted as a  concern during a previous inspection and not addressed sufficiently.  This is a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  During the inspection we found one person's room was covered in faeces. We immediately alerted the  management team to our findings. The care supervisor was unable to demonstrate that they were cleaning  schedules for the room and home to demonstrate that the room was regularly being cleaned and checked  despite informing us that this was a recurring event. In addition on reviewing the person's care plans and  risk assessment it was apparent that this information had not been recorded or assessed in regards to how  the service was going to mitigate any risks of infection control to either the person or other people who may  access the bedroom.  Care records, plans and assessments were very generic and did not take account of people's individual  needs effectively. During the inspection, the temperature exceeded 25 Degrees Celsius. Every person had a  heat risk assessment in place; but it did not reflect their personal circumstances. For example, one person  who was diabetic did not have this considered as part of the risk assessment and records we reviewed  showed the person was assessed as medium risk. The person's nutritional risk assessment stated they were  at high nutritional risk in addition they were on warfarin however this did not appear to have been  incorporated in the heat risk assessment. This meant the person would be at high risk of dehydration and  the service had failed to highlight this. Another person had been assessed as being at low risk however they  were bed-bound and needed assistance and encouragement from staff to ensure they ate and drank well.  We reviewed 42 heat risk assessments which showed most people had been deemed at risk of dehydration  and sunburn, however  this was not always relevant in all cases for example one person who was bed-bound and did not access the outdoors it was identified that were they would be exposed to direct sunlight. The  heat risk assessment form being used by the service lacked clarity on what HIGH, MED, LOW level risks stood  for which meant staff completing the form were unable to inform us what and why actions needed to be  taken. The care supervisor and deputy manager informed us that all staff were aware of the need to push  fluids however records of people's fluid intake also did not demonstrate that this area of people's care was  being provided effectively.   Care plans and risk assessments we reviewed for one person showed us that despite being assessed by  healthcare professionals to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, on reviewing their turning chart in their  room we found that the person spent most of the time their back. The inspector discussed this with the care  supervisor and they informed us that the person did not like to lay on their side so staff left the person them  on their back. This information was not recorded in their care plan/risk assessment neither was there  information on how staff would monitor and manage the risk of pressure sores.   This is a breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  In general, staff were able to indicate how people may be at risk of harm or abuse and how they would go  about protecting them and ensuring their safety. Staff knew about the provider's whistleblowing policy and  procedures. Staff told us that they would escalate their concerns to the registered manager. If the concerns  were about the registered manager staff stated they would contact the provider and/or other external   8 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  agencies, such as Social Services.      We found the risk to some people was not always well managed, for example, we observed staff attempting  to mobilise one person in a four-wheeled rollator, this put the person at risk as this rollator was being used  for the wrong purpose and a four wheeled-rollator is to aid people to walk rather than being used as a  wheelchair. However the person did not injure themselves on this occasion.  During the inspection we were informed by the care supervisor that currently there was only one on going  safeguarding investigation, however after the inspection we received information from the local authority  which showed that during the period 06 April 2016 to 14 August 2017 they had received 21 safeguarding  concerns/alerts. One alert was in respect of neglect however the investigation was not taken further and a  further 20 concerns were for neglect/physical abuse and institutional abuse. Two safeguarding concerns  had been substantiated by the Local Authority, three partially substantiated and five have been  'unsubstantiated' and closed.  The remaining safeguarding concerns are subject to on-going investigation.  The care supervisor/home manager was unable to demonstrate to us that all safeguarding incidents were  thoroughly analysed and measures put in place to mitigate re-occurrence. This meant that people remained at risk as the processes in place to safeguard people from potential incidents remained inadequate.   This is a breach of Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  The service ensured that it employed suitable staff because a clear recruitment process was followed. This  made sure that staff were suitable to work with people in a care setting. Relevant checks had been carried  out including obtaining at least two references, ensuring that the applicant provided proof of their identity  and undertaking a criminal record check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).  We observed a staff member during their medication administration duties and they ensured that people  received their prescribed medicines safely, as required and in a timely manner. Staff administered medicines to people in a way that showed respect for their individual needs, for example, they explained what was  happening, sought people's consent to administer their medicines and stayed with them while they took  their medicines to ensure that it had been administered safely. Staff had received training in administering  medicines and had their practice checked periodically. We reviewed medicine administration records and  found these to be in good order. Medicines were stored and disposed safely.  9 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  Is the service effective?  Our findings    Although staff training records showed and staff told us that they had received suitable training to meet  the needs of the people they supported, this was not embedded in their everyday practice. Staff told us that  the majority of the training provided was through e-learning or watching a video and staff did feel that this  was an appropriate method to aid their knowledge, understanding in their role or test their competency.  Of the five staff files we reviewed, we found that these staff had not received up to date training nor had their competencies been assessed since commencing employment. One staff member commenced employment  in April 2017 and had no training record on file; the only documentation we could find was certificates for  NVQ2 and attendance at a moving and lifting workshop from 2004.  We found in another staff member's file  training dating back to the 29 September 2016 however; we noted that they had only recently returned to  work after a period of time away but had not had any refresher training. None of the management team  present were able to demonstrate any other documentation or observations to show that staff were using  their training appropriately and adhering to best practice.   Several people were living with dementia, some in the early stages of the condition whilst others were living  with more advanced dementia. Although staff told us they had received training relating to dementia, we  found examples of poor staff practice which indicated a lack of understanding and application of the  learning from training provided. Some staff did not demonstrate an understanding of how to support  people living with dementia and how this affected people in their daily lives; for example, some staff did not  communicate effectively with individual people or provide positive interactions.  One person tried to initiate  a conversation with a member of staff and held out their hand. The member of staff was observed to be  dismissive. Although the member of staff was seen to look at the person, they walked out of the room  without responding to them. The training did not equip staff to communicate effectively with people living  with dementia nor had communication difficulties. We observed another staff member mobilising a person  in a four wheeled rollator, this put the person at risk as this rollator was being used for the wrong purpose.  Purpose of this rollator is to be used as a walking aid with a perching stool when the person using it wishes  to rest. The staff member was using this as a wheelchair which was not the purpose and it had not been risk  assessed. The member of staff's training record showed that they had received training in manual handling  which included safe moving and mobilising of staff.  Staff informed us that when they commenced employment they went through an induction programme,  had on-going training, one to one support, team meetings and daily handovers. We found that the majority  of the staff had not received regular supervision in the last 12 months. Staff confirmed that there was not   10 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  enough time in the day for formal supervision to be undertaken.   Staff records did not demonstrate that all staff had received regular supervision. For example, one staff  member had been working for the service since 28/09/2016 but had only had one supervision on the 08  December 2016; this was in relation to the staff member not completing documentation correctly. On  further review of the staff member's file, we found it had been recorded that they had been struggling to  communicate, as English was not their first language. The staff member informed us that at times they felt  isolated and left out of conversations due to not being able to understand what was being said. Senior  management could not find any records or information to demonstrate that the service was offering them  any support to further develop their language or understanding.  No risk assessment had been completed  for the member of staff in relation to this and their competency in their job role or the potential impact this  could have on how they communicated with those they were supporting effectively.   Where staff supervisions showed discussion of poor practice had been held, there was no follow up  documentation to show what improvements were made and how this was being monitored and checked.  For example we noted that one staff member had attended supervision for failing to record people's daily  care progress, however there was no record of actions the service was taking to support the member of staff. Records did not demonstrate that supervision was being used as a platform to enable staff to express any  challenges they may be experiencing, rather our findings suggested supervision was being used as a tool to  reprimand staff for any wrong doing.  This is a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005(MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best  interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and  hospitals are called DoLS.   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The care supervisor/manager had an  understanding of the principles and practice of the MCA and DoLS. Multi-disciplinary meetings had taken  place for people in order to review their circumstances and ensure that everyone acted in their best interests in line with legislation. One relative told us that they had been involved in meetings to discuss their relative's mental capacity and expressed to us that they were confident that they could work with the manager and  care workers to support their relative's decision making.  We found mental capacity assessments on day to day decision making to be based on people's cognitive  impairment diagnosis. For example, people had been deemed not to have capacity to make any day to day  decisions due to them having dementia.  Each individual's needs should have been assessed as capacity  can vary depending on the decision being made, for example what clothes they liked to wear, where they  would like to eat their meal, choice of food, the time they got up in the morning and the time they retired to  bed and how they liked to spend the rest of their day.  People's dining experience was not always positive. The service needed to improve the way mealtimes were  organised and how choices were offered to people, including offering clear support and explanations to   11 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  people which choices were being served. Although staff were heard asking if the food was satisfactory and  people were offered some encouragement to eat, there was no explanation nor description of what people  were eating. However we did see some positive experiences for some people, as staff were observed  supporting people to eat in the lounge and one person in their bedroom. Staff were seated next to or in front of the person they were assisting and were heard to encourage an upright sitting position.   We spoke to the care supervisor who could not demonstrate if the service had consulted people or their  relatives as to what food and drink they would like to have or how it was prepared. The care supervisor  informed they were in the process of making visual aids menus as the previous manager had removed the  old ones.   Improvements were required in the way the premises were maintained to meet people's individual needs by the adaptation, design and decoration of the service. We found the premises tired, worn and in need of  redecoration and refurbishment throughout.  12 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Requires Improvement  Is the service caring?  Our findings    Although some people told us that staff were kind and caring and relatives said, ""Staff here are very nice,   my relative has been to several other homes before this one and the care they receive here is very good.""  and, ""When my relative first moved here twelve months ago we were told that they only had days to live  however since coming here their health has improved immensely."", we found that some staff were not  knowledgeable of people's individual care needs nor did they have knowledge of their histories and  backgrounds.   Staff did not always support people in a person centred way, their responses and interactions with people  were often task led and routine based. For example, people, at times, had to wait long periods before being  supported and people were not being engaged. Where staff did speak to people, although they did so in a  calm, respectful manner, they did not also allow them the time they needed to carry out any tasks.  For those people able to communicate verbally, we were told that staff treated them with dignity and  respect. People's privacy was respected and they were able to spend time in their bedrooms or in  communal areas as they preferred. Although most staff's practice demonstrated an understanding of the  need to treat everyone with dignity and respect this was not always the case for those living with dementia  who experienced poor care outcomes at times because staff did not attempt to engage with them to help  them maintain their dignity.  Some people were asked for their views and were involved in their day to day care through being offered  choice as far as possible in their daily lives. Some relatives we spoke with confirmed that they had been  involved in care planning and felt their views were listened to. One relative told us, ""The manager and care staff are always around if I have any questions."" We spoke to relatives who  informed us that the service always sought advocacy support when needed to ensure that people had an  independent voice, in addition, we found information on advocacy support posted around the home. This  meant that people and their relatives had access to the information should they require it. Advocacy  services support and enable people to express their views and concerns and may provide independent advice and assistance.  We noted that people were smartly dressed. Staff informed us that people's well-being and dignity was very  important to them and ensuring that people were well-presented was an important part of their caring role.  People were able to maintain contact and continue to be supported by their friends and relatives. People's  relatives told us that they were able to visit the service at any time without restrictions.  13 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  Is the service responsive?  Our findings    At our last inspection in November 2016, we had concerns about person centred care and people's   involvement in their care delivery and activities. At this inspection, we found that the improvements had not  taken place and people were not being supported as individuals and their individual social interests and  well-being was not very well catered for.  We found that people's care was not always planned and assessed to ensure their safety and welfare. We  checked seven care plans which  were not fully reflective or accurate of people's care needs. People's care  plans did not contain sufficient relevant information on how their dementia affected their day-to-day living  and how they were to be supported. They did not include details about people's strengths, abilities and  aspirations. For example, people admitted from hospital did not always have care plans in place for staff to  understand and meet their needs. At the time of our inspection, we found one person who had recently  been admitted from hospital, had no care plans in place.  There was an 'Assessment of Needs' document  provided by the local NHS Hospital but no guidance for staff on how to support the person, any associated  risks or the steps to take to mitigate these. We found some staff to have no knowledge about the person's  preference.   Individual's preferences relating to their diet had not been considered. We saw that the chef and kitchen  staff did not have an up to date list of people's dietary requirements. For example, one person's care plan  stated that they were to have a kosher diet and this would be brought in by their relative, however we  observed staff providing them with food from the kitchen which the person declined as they knew this was  not kosher food. Information on this was not recorded in the person's care plan and staff, including the chef  were unaware of their dietary needs. We discussed this with the care supervisor who told us interim  arrangements had been made with the relative to bring in food; however we noted that this information had also not been recorded or reflected in the care plan. This had not been identified by any of the service's  quality assurance processes and, although action was then taken to communicate and share dietary needs,  the inspector had initiated this. In addition, we found the dietary needs list provided to the kitchen staff had  not been updated and contained names of people who were no longer in the service and some people in  the service who had dietary needs had not been added to the list. This however was resolved immediately  after we discussed it with the kitchen staff.  Where there had been efforts made to provide people with specific care this was not being adhered to. For  example, we observed staff not using 'flash cards' when communicating with one person who had very  limited understanding of English. There was no reference of flash cards contained in the communication   14 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  care plan although this was recorded in other areas of the care record. Staff were not routinely using the  cards and on one occasion we had to remind a staff member that the person had them to aid their  communication. As a result, the person was isolated as no other methods had been explored to  communicate effectively either in their own language or through other tools such as google translate.  People did not always receive care in a person centered way because the deployment of staff meant the   approach was mainly task and routine focused. For example, an activities coordinator had been supplied  with a monthly activities plan by head office. The activities coordinator told us that people had not been  consulted or involved in the choice of the activities on the plan.  This meant that interactions between staff  and people were primarily focused around the provision of drinks and meals and not about what they  wanted to do or when they wanted to do it. Our observations throughout the inspection showed that there  were few opportunities provided for people to join in with social activities to ensure that their time was  spent in a meaningful way.   Throughout our inspection we found the all lounges to be uninviting and held little to occupy a people. The  lounge had an institutional feel, with the chairs set out along the three walls with the television at one end of the room. We spent five hours observing people in the downstairs lounges. During this time, we observed  that the television aerial had not been working, this was further supported by a person we spoke to who told us, ""The aerial has not been working since the weekend, I am lucky I have my tablet so I can watch my  programmes."" We carried out room checks and found that several of the TV's in people's rooms did not have an aerial signal. This was brought to the attention of the care supervisor who informed us that they were  waiting for the maintenance person to access the roof and check if all the connections were in place and  connected.   This is a breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  People and their relatives told us that if they had any concerns then they would discuss these with the  management team or staff on duty. People told us that they felt able to talk freely to staff about any  concerns or complaints and they would be addressed when brought to the attention of the management  team. Staff told us that they were aware of the complaints procedure and knew how to respond to people's  concerns. There was a policy and procedure in place and people's concerns had been listened to and acted  upon. Records showed us that concerns and complaints had been raised and responded to in timely  manner. However, we found there were no comprehensive systems in place to demonstrate that  management learnt from concerns and complaints and that formal analysis of concerns and complaints  had been undertaken.  15 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  Is the service well-led?  Our findings    At our inspection in November 2016 we found that the quality assurance arrangements and processes   which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service required improvement. At this inspection,  we found that no improvement had been made.  At the time of the inspection the service did not have a registered manager in place as the previous  registered manager had left. After the inspection the provider informed us that recruitment had started for  an experienced manager to manage the service. Despite the presence of the care supervisor, there was lack  of clear leadership in regards to who was managing and running the service. Staff told us that they found the change of managerial roles confusing as they were not always sure who to go to for advice and support.  However, some staff did inform us that one of the providers did spend  a lot of time in the home and were  always helpful and offered staff support.   Roles and responsibilities were unclear and staff were unsure what they were accountable for. The culture of the service was not a positive one and staff lacked time, knowledge and understanding. Observations during our inspection showed there was no effective leadership. The care supervisor/home manager informed us  that they had  limited communication with the provider and were yet to meet them to discuss the progress  of the service.    We found the service to be continually failing to ensure that there were robust systems in place for effective  oversight and governance, to ensure people were living in a safe environment, supported by adequate  numbers of staff, competent in their roles and deployed in a way which met people's needs effectively. The  provider and care supervisor had not been proactive in checking that improvements were being made and  were largely left unaccountable whilst placing the blame with the failure of previous manager; this included  those responsible for oversight of quality and training.   Quality assurance systems and processes which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service  were not effective or established. The provider and manager could not evidence any effective systems or  processes which assessed, monitored or mitigated the risks relating to the health, safety and welfare of  people using the service. The provider and care supervisor/home manager was unable to demonstrate how  they continually analysed, evaluated and sought to improve their governance and auditing practices in line  with their own quality assurance policy.  Records relating to staff employed and people who used the service were not properly maintained. This   16 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  related to staff training, induction and supervision. Where an internal audit and areas for improvement had  been highlighted, the provider and care supervisor failed to demonstrate that actions needed had been  completed or whether they required to be followed-up further. For example, the audit in December 2016  highlighted that care plans for people newly admitted to the service required completion and risk  assessments required review. Our evidence at this inspection on 10 July 2017 showed that these remained  outstanding and had not been completed. The provider did not have an effective system in place to review  staffing levels to ensure that the deployment of staff was suitable to meet people's needs. It was apparent  from our inspection that the absence of robust quality monitoring was a contributory factor to the failure of  the provider to recognise breaches or any risk of breaches with regulatory requirements sooner.   Support and resources needed to run the service were not available and the provider was not operating the  service in line with their own philosophy of care which stated that, 'Our belief in caring for the elderly is to  maintain the highest standards of quality care. Our abiding personal and professional concern is  safeguarding the interest and well-being of all residents as well as offering person-centred care.'   This is a breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  Since our inspection we have written to the provider highlighting several concerns we found and have  requested an action plan to be drafted, on how the service will improve care and treatment for people using  the service.  17 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Enforcement actions  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have taken enforcement action.

Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health  and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  There were no systems in place to ensure that staff were deployed in a way which met people's changing  needs and circumstances. This meant that staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs  were met and people were put at potential risk of harm.  Care records, plans, and assessments were very generic and did not take account of people's individual  needs effectively. Information had not always been recorded or assessed to demonstrate how the service  was going to mitigate any risks to people's safety. People were at risk as the processes in place to safeguard  people from potential incidents remained inadequate.   Staff training had not been embedded in everyday practice. Staff training was out of date in some cases and  their competency to perform their duties had not been reviewed. Staff did not receive regular supervision  and support, which meant that staff lacked the skills and support to perform their roles effectively.   Improvements were required to the way in which the service assessed people's capacity to make decisions  and how they supported people to make choices. People's dining experience was not always positive. The  service needed to improve the way mealtimes were organised and how choices were offered to people,  including offering clear support and explanations to people which choices were being served.  Some staff were not knowledgeable of people's individual care needs nor did they have knowledge of their  histories and backgrounds so as to enable them to deliver personalised care in all instances. People's care  was not always planned and assessed to ensure their safety and welfare. Individual's preferences relating to  their diet had not been considered. Where there had been efforts made to provide people with specific care  this was not being adhered to. People did not always receive care in a person centered way because the  deployment of staff meant the  approach was mainly task and routine focused.  Roles and responsibilities were unclear and staff were unsure what they were accountable for. The culture of the service was not a positive one and staff lacked time, knowledge and understanding. Quality assurance  systems and processes, which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service were not effective  or established. Support and resources needed to run the service were not available and the provider was  not operating the service in line with their own philosophy of care. The lack of good quality governance had  impacted on the delivery of safe and effective care.  There was a complaints procedure in place. Relatives told us that they would speak with the manager if they had any concerns or complaints, however some relatives were unsure if they would be listened to. There  was not a comprehensive system in place to demonstrate that lessons were learnt from past concerns and  complaints or that formal analysis of concerns and complaints had been undertaken.   There was thorough recruitment procedures in place to ensure staff were suitable to work with vulnerable  adults. This was carried out by the head office. Medications were managed safely and as needed.  3 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not safe.  Staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs  were met and people were put at potential risk of harm.  Care records, plans and assessments were very generic and did  not take account of people's individual needs effectively..   Medicines were stored and disposed safely and medication  management was safe.  	  The service was not effective.  Staff did not have a structured opportunity to discuss their  practice and development to ensure that they continued to  deliver care effectively to people.  Improvements were required to ensure that staff's training was  effective and good practice was embedded through their  everyday practices with people who used the service.  The dining experience for people was variable and not always  appropriate to meet people's individual nutritional needs.  	  The service was not always caring.  Not all care provided was person centred, caring and kind.  People and those acting on their behalf were not always involved in the planning of their care.  People were not always treated with dignity and respect.  	  The service was not responsive to people's needs.  4 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate    Inadequate    Requires Improvement    Inadequate    People were not always engaged in meaningful activities and  supported to pursue pastimes that interested them, particularly  for people living with dementia.  Not all people's care records were sufficiently detailed or  accurate.  Staff were not consistently responsive to people's needs.  Arrangements were in place for the management of complaints  however they had not proved effective.  	"  The service was not well-led.	  There was no registered manager.  There was a lack of oversight and scrutiny by the provider.   The quality assurance system was not effective because it had  not identified the areas of concern and there were no plans in  place to address them.  Inadequate    5 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018     Whittingham House  "	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the registered manager was meeting  the legal requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the  overall quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on the 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 July 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was  undertaken by two inspectors and a pharmacist inspector.  We reviewed other information that we held about the service such as notifications. These are the events  happening in the service that the registered manager is required to tell us about. We used this information to plan what areas we were going to focus on during our inspection.  As part of the inspection we spoke with seven people who used the service, five relatives and 10 members of  care staff, deputy manager, care team manager and care supervisor. We also spoke with the local authority's contracts and social work team.  Some people were unable to communicate with us verbally to tell us about the quality of the service  provided and how they were cared for by staff. We therefore used observations, speaking with staff, and  relatives, reviewing care records and other information to help us assess how people's care needs were  being met. We spent time observing care in the communal areas and used the Short Observational  Framework for Inspection (SOFI). SOFI is a way of observing care to help us understand the experience of  people who could not talk with us.  As part of this inspection we reviewed 10 people's care records. We looked at the recruitment and support  records for five members of staff. We reviewed other records such as medicines management, complaints  and compliments information, quality monitoring, audit information and maintenance records.  6 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  	  	"    During and prior to our inspection, we had concerns about the amount of staff available to meet people's  care and support needs. People's views on staffing levels and how they were deployed  were mixed. One  person informed us, ""I am no longer able to walk so I need support to get to the lounge; however I opt to  stay in my room as I have to wait about an hour for staff to come and help me."" Relatives expressed  concerns that when they have visited, they had not been able to find a member of staff to support or assist  their relative.  Staff we spoke with told us they felt there were not enough of them to meet the needs of people in a timely  and safe manner. One staff member informed us, ""In the morning and night time we can be rushed as we  trying to either get everyone up for breakfast or ready for bed."" Although some staff told us that staffing  levels were acceptable and they could meet people's day to day needs, others informed us staffing levels  were inadequate to meet people's needs and that this could be stressful especially at busy period of the day.  On the ground floor, we found staff to be alert to any concerns or dangers resulting from people's choices,  being distressed or anxious, however on the first floor despite staff being alert to people's needs, staff were  rushed and task focused and often there was a lack of presence.   Our observations on the first day of the inspection showed that although there were staff on duty, there were five people sitting in the back dining room/lounge with one person who was regularly calling out for help.  During this time, no staff came into the lounge to ascertain why the person was distressed. This was due to  the members of staff supporting people with their care needs elsewhere.  This appeared to upset other  people sitting in the lounge. Due to the amount of distress that was being shown by this person.   The care supervisor informed us that they used the resident forum tool to determine people's dependencies  and the required staffing levels. The care supervisor informed us during the inspection that they felt the  current dependency tool used did not give a true reflection of people's current care needs. The care  supervisor had recently completed 20 Barthel dependency assessments and found that 17/20 of the  completed assessments reflected that the people's needs were higher than being currently assessed. There  was no systems in place to ensure that staff were deployed in a way which met people's changing needs and circumstances. This meant that staffing levels were not adequate to ensure that people's needs were met  and people were put at potential risk of harm.   7 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  After the inspection, we wrote to the provider raising our concerns around staffing levels in the home. The  provider responded advising that staffing levels would be increased to ensure that people's needs were  being met adequately. Although this was encouraging, we judged the service to be in breach of regulation  due to the poor care outcomes people had experienced and because this had already been highlighted as a  concern during a previous inspection and not addressed sufficiently.  This is a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  During the inspection we found one person's room was covered in faeces. We immediately alerted the  management team to our findings. The care supervisor was unable to demonstrate that they were cleaning  schedules for the room and home to demonstrate that the room was regularly being cleaned and checked  despite informing us that this was a recurring event. In addition on reviewing the person's care plans and  risk assessment it was apparent that this information had not been recorded or assessed in regards to how  the service was going to mitigate any risks of infection control to either the person or other people who may  access the bedroom.  Care records, plans and assessments were very generic and did not take account of people's individual  needs effectively. During the inspection, the temperature exceeded 25 Degrees Celsius. Every person had a  heat risk assessment in place; but it did not reflect their personal circumstances. For example, one person  who was diabetic did not have this considered as part of the risk assessment and records we reviewed  showed the person was assessed as medium risk. The person's nutritional risk assessment stated they were  at high nutritional risk in addition they were on warfarin however this did not appear to have been  incorporated in the heat risk assessment. This meant the person would be at high risk of dehydration and  the service had failed to highlight this. Another person had been assessed as being at low risk however they  were bed-bound and needed assistance and encouragement from staff to ensure they ate and drank well.  We reviewed 42 heat risk assessments which showed most people had been deemed at risk of dehydration  and sunburn, however  this was not always relevant in all cases for example one person who was bed-bound and did not access the outdoors it was identified that were they would be exposed to direct sunlight. The  heat risk assessment form being used by the service lacked clarity on what HIGH, MED, LOW level risks stood  for which meant staff completing the form were unable to inform us what and why actions needed to be  taken. The care supervisor and deputy manager informed us that all staff were aware of the need to push  fluids however records of people's fluid intake also did not demonstrate that this area of people's care was  being provided effectively.   Care plans and risk assessments we reviewed for one person showed us that despite being assessed by  healthcare professionals to be at risk of developing pressure ulcers, on reviewing their turning chart in their  room we found that the person spent most of the time their back. The inspector discussed this with the care  supervisor and they informed us that the person did not like to lay on their side so staff left the person them  on their back. This information was not recorded in their care plan/risk assessment neither was there  information on how staff would monitor and manage the risk of pressure sores.   This is a breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  In general, staff were able to indicate how people may be at risk of harm or abuse and how they would go  about protecting them and ensuring their safety. Staff knew about the provider's whistleblowing policy and  procedures. Staff told us that they would escalate their concerns to the registered manager. If the concerns  were about the registered manager staff stated they would contact the provider and/or other external   8 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  agencies, such as Social Services.      We found the risk to some people was not always well managed, for example, we observed staff attempting  to mobilise one person in a four-wheeled rollator, this put the person at risk as this rollator was being used  for the wrong purpose and a four wheeled-rollator is to aid people to walk rather than being used as a  wheelchair. However the person did not injure themselves on this occasion.  During the inspection we were informed by the care supervisor that currently there was only one on going  safeguarding investigation, however after the inspection we received information from the local authority  which showed that during the period 06 April 2016 to 14 August 2017 they had received 21 safeguarding  concerns/alerts. One alert was in respect of neglect however the investigation was not taken further and a  further 20 concerns were for neglect/physical abuse and institutional abuse. Two safeguarding concerns  had been substantiated by the Local Authority, three partially substantiated and five have been  'unsubstantiated' and closed.  The remaining safeguarding concerns are subject to on-going investigation.  The care supervisor/home manager was unable to demonstrate to us that all safeguarding incidents were  thoroughly analysed and measures put in place to mitigate re-occurrence. This meant that people remained at risk as the processes in place to safeguard people from potential incidents remained inadequate.   This is a breach of Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  The service ensured that it employed suitable staff because a clear recruitment process was followed. This  made sure that staff were suitable to work with people in a care setting. Relevant checks had been carried  out including obtaining at least two references, ensuring that the applicant provided proof of their identity  and undertaking a criminal record check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).  We observed a staff member during their medication administration duties and they ensured that people  received their prescribed medicines safely, as required and in a timely manner. Staff administered medicines to people in a way that showed respect for their individual needs, for example, they explained what was  happening, sought people's consent to administer their medicines and stayed with them while they took  their medicines to ensure that it had been administered safely. Staff had received training in administering  medicines and had their practice checked periodically. We reviewed medicine administration records and  found these to be in good order. Medicines were stored and disposed safely.  9 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  "	  	    Although staff training records showed and staff told us that they had received suitable training to meet  the needs of the people they supported, this was not embedded in their everyday practice. Staff told us that  the majority of the training provided was through e-learning or watching a video and staff did feel that this  was an appropriate method to aid their knowledge, understanding in their role or test their competency.  Of the five staff files we reviewed, we found that these staff had not received up to date training nor had their competencies been assessed since commencing employment. One staff member commenced employment  in April 2017 and had no training record on file; the only documentation we could find was certificates for  NVQ2 and attendance at a moving and lifting workshop from 2004.  We found in another staff member's file  training dating back to the 29 September 2016 however; we noted that they had only recently returned to  work after a period of time away but had not had any refresher training. None of the management team  present were able to demonstrate any other documentation or observations to show that staff were using  their training appropriately and adhering to best practice.   Several people were living with dementia, some in the early stages of the condition whilst others were living  with more advanced dementia. Although staff told us they had received training relating to dementia, we  found examples of poor staff practice which indicated a lack of understanding and application of the  learning from training provided. Some staff did not demonstrate an understanding of how to support  people living with dementia and how this affected people in their daily lives; for example, some staff did not  communicate effectively with individual people or provide positive interactions.  One person tried to initiate  a conversation with a member of staff and held out their hand. The member of staff was observed to be  dismissive. Although the member of staff was seen to look at the person, they walked out of the room  without responding to them. The training did not equip staff to communicate effectively with people living  with dementia nor had communication difficulties. We observed another staff member mobilising a person  in a four wheeled rollator, this put the person at risk as this rollator was being used for the wrong purpose.  Purpose of this rollator is to be used as a walking aid with a perching stool when the person using it wishes  to rest. The staff member was using this as a wheelchair which was not the purpose and it had not been risk  assessed. The member of staff's training record showed that they had received training in manual handling  which included safe moving and mobilising of staff.  Staff informed us that when they commenced employment they went through an induction programme,  had on-going training, one to one support, team meetings and daily handovers. We found that the majority  of the staff had not received regular supervision in the last 12 months. Staff confirmed that there was not   10 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  enough time in the day for formal supervision to be undertaken.   Staff records did not demonstrate that all staff had received regular supervision. For example, one staff  member had been working for the service since 28/09/2016 but had only had one supervision on the 08  December 2016; this was in relation to the staff member not completing documentation correctly. On  further review of the staff member's file, we found it had been recorded that they had been struggling to  communicate, as English was not their first language. The staff member informed us that at times they felt  isolated and left out of conversations due to not being able to understand what was being said. Senior  management could not find any records or information to demonstrate that the service was offering them  any support to further develop their language or understanding.  No risk assessment had been completed  for the member of staff in relation to this and their competency in their job role or the potential impact this  could have on how they communicated with those they were supporting effectively.   Where staff supervisions showed discussion of poor practice had been held, there was no follow up  documentation to show what improvements were made and how this was being monitored and checked.  For example we noted that one staff member had attended supervision for failing to record people's daily  care progress, however there was no record of actions the service was taking to support the member of staff. Records did not demonstrate that supervision was being used as a platform to enable staff to express any  challenges they may be experiencing, rather our findings suggested supervision was being used as a tool to  reprimand staff for any wrong doing.  This is a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  The Mental Capacity Act 2005(MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best  interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and  hospitals are called DoLS.   We checked whether the service was working within the principles of the MCA, and whether any conditions  on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty were being met. The care supervisor/manager had an  understanding of the principles and practice of the MCA and DoLS. Multi-disciplinary meetings had taken  place for people in order to review their circumstances and ensure that everyone acted in their best interests in line with legislation. One relative told us that they had been involved in meetings to discuss their relative's mental capacity and expressed to us that they were confident that they could work with the manager and  care workers to support their relative's decision making.  We found mental capacity assessments on day to day decision making to be based on people's cognitive  impairment diagnosis. For example, people had been deemed not to have capacity to make any day to day  decisions due to them having dementia.  Each individual's needs should have been assessed as capacity  can vary depending on the decision being made, for example what clothes they liked to wear, where they  would like to eat their meal, choice of food, the time they got up in the morning and the time they retired to  bed and how they liked to spend the rest of their day.  People's dining experience was not always positive. The service needed to improve the way mealtimes were  organised and how choices were offered to people, including offering clear support and explanations to   11 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  people which choices were being served. Although staff were heard asking if the food was satisfactory and  people were offered some encouragement to eat, there was no explanation nor description of what people  were eating. However we did see some positive experiences for some people, as staff were observed  supporting people to eat in the lounge and one person in their bedroom. Staff were seated next to or in front of the person they were assisting and were heard to encourage an upright sitting position.   We spoke to the care supervisor who could not demonstrate if the service had consulted people or their  relatives as to what food and drink they would like to have or how it was prepared. The care supervisor  informed they were in the process of making visual aids menus as the previous manager had removed the  old ones.   Improvements were required in the way the premises were maintained to meet people's individual needs by the adaptation, design and decoration of the service. We found the premises tired, worn and in need of  redecoration and refurbishment throughout.  12 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Requires Improvement  	  	"    Although some people told us that staff were kind and caring and relatives said, ""Staff here are very nice,   my relative has been to several other homes before this one and the care they receive here is very good.""  and, ""When my relative first moved here twelve months ago we were told that they only had days to live  however since coming here their health has improved immensely."", we found that some staff were not  knowledgeable of people's individual care needs nor did they have knowledge of their histories and  backgrounds.   Staff did not always support people in a person centred way, their responses and interactions with people  were often task led and routine based. For example, people, at times, had to wait long periods before being  supported and people were not being engaged. Where staff did speak to people, although they did so in a  calm, respectful manner, they did not also allow them the time they needed to carry out any tasks.  For those people able to communicate verbally, we were told that staff treated them with dignity and  respect. People's privacy was respected and they were able to spend time in their bedrooms or in  communal areas as they preferred. Although most staff's practice demonstrated an understanding of the  need to treat everyone with dignity and respect this was not always the case for those living with dementia  who experienced poor care outcomes at times because staff did not attempt to engage with them to help  them maintain their dignity.  Some people were asked for their views and were involved in their day to day care through being offered  choice as far as possible in their daily lives. Some relatives we spoke with confirmed that they had been  involved in care planning and felt their views were listened to. One relative told us, ""The manager and care staff are always around if I have any questions."" We spoke to relatives who  informed us that the service always sought advocacy support when needed to ensure that people had an  independent voice, in addition, we found information on advocacy support posted around the home. This  meant that people and their relatives had access to the information should they require it. Advocacy  services support and enable people to express their views and concerns and may provide independent advice and assistance.  We noted that people were smartly dressed. Staff informed us that people's well-being and dignity was very  important to them and ensuring that people were well-presented was an important part of their caring role.  People were able to maintain contact and continue to be supported by their friends and relatives. People's  relatives told us that they were able to visit the service at any time without restrictions.  13 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  "	  	"    At our last inspection in November 2016, we had concerns about person centred care and people's   involvement in their care delivery and activities. At this inspection, we found that the improvements had not  taken place and people were not being supported as individuals and their individual social interests and  well-being was not very well catered for.  We found that people's care was not always planned and assessed to ensure their safety and welfare. We  checked seven care plans which  were not fully reflective or accurate of people's care needs. People's care  plans did not contain sufficient relevant information on how their dementia affected their day-to-day living  and how they were to be supported. They did not include details about people's strengths, abilities and  aspirations. For example, people admitted from hospital did not always have care plans in place for staff to  understand and meet their needs. At the time of our inspection, we found one person who had recently  been admitted from hospital, had no care plans in place.  There was an 'Assessment of Needs' document  provided by the local NHS Hospital but no guidance for staff on how to support the person, any associated  risks or the steps to take to mitigate these. We found some staff to have no knowledge about the person's  preference.   Individual's preferences relating to their diet had not been considered. We saw that the chef and kitchen  staff did not have an up to date list of people's dietary requirements. For example, one person's care plan  stated that they were to have a kosher diet and this would be brought in by their relative, however we  observed staff providing them with food from the kitchen which the person declined as they knew this was  not kosher food. Information on this was not recorded in the person's care plan and staff, including the chef  were unaware of their dietary needs. We discussed this with the care supervisor who told us interim  arrangements had been made with the relative to bring in food; however we noted that this information had also not been recorded or reflected in the care plan. This had not been identified by any of the service's  quality assurance processes and, although action was then taken to communicate and share dietary needs,  the inspector had initiated this. In addition, we found the dietary needs list provided to the kitchen staff had  not been updated and contained names of people who were no longer in the service and some people in  the service who had dietary needs had not been added to the list. This however was resolved immediately  after we discussed it with the kitchen staff.  Where there had been efforts made to provide people with specific care this was not being adhered to. For  example, we observed staff not using 'flash cards' when communicating with one person who had very  limited understanding of English. There was no reference of flash cards contained in the communication   14 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  care plan although this was recorded in other areas of the care record. Staff were not routinely using the  cards and on one occasion we had to remind a staff member that the person had them to aid their  communication. As a result, the person was isolated as no other methods had been explored to  communicate effectively either in their own language or through other tools such as google translate.  People did not always receive care in a person centered way because the deployment of staff meant the   approach was mainly task and routine focused. For example, an activities coordinator had been supplied  with a monthly activities plan by head office. The activities coordinator told us that people had not been  consulted or involved in the choice of the activities on the plan.  This meant that interactions between staff  and people were primarily focused around the provision of drinks and meals and not about what they  wanted to do or when they wanted to do it. Our observations throughout the inspection showed that there  were few opportunities provided for people to join in with social activities to ensure that their time was  spent in a meaningful way.   Throughout our inspection we found the all lounges to be uninviting and held little to occupy a people. The  lounge had an institutional feel, with the chairs set out along the three walls with the television at one end of the room. We spent five hours observing people in the downstairs lounges. During this time, we observed  that the television aerial had not been working, this was further supported by a person we spoke to who told us, ""The aerial has not been working since the weekend, I am lucky I have my tablet so I can watch my  programmes."" We carried out room checks and found that several of the TV's in people's rooms did not have an aerial signal. This was brought to the attention of the care supervisor who informed us that they were  waiting for the maintenance person to access the roof and check if all the connections were in place and  connected.   This is a breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  People and their relatives told us that if they had any concerns then they would discuss these with the  management team or staff on duty. People told us that they felt able to talk freely to staff about any  concerns or complaints and they would be addressed when brought to the attention of the management  team. Staff told us that they were aware of the complaints procedure and knew how to respond to people's  concerns. There was a policy and procedure in place and people's concerns had been listened to and acted  upon. Records showed us that concerns and complaints had been raised and responded to in timely  manner. However, we found there were no comprehensive systems in place to demonstrate that  management learnt from concerns and complaints and that formal analysis of concerns and complaints  had been undertaken.  15 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  Inadequate  "	  	    At our inspection in November 2016 we found that the quality assurance arrangements and processes   which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service required improvement. At this inspection,  we found that no improvement had been made.  At the time of the inspection the service did not have a registered manager in place as the previous  registered manager had left. After the inspection the provider informed us that recruitment had started for  an experienced manager to manage the service. Despite the presence of the care supervisor, there was lack  of clear leadership in regards to who was managing and running the service. Staff told us that they found the change of managerial roles confusing as they were not always sure who to go to for advice and support.  However, some staff did inform us that one of the providers did spend  a lot of time in the home and were  always helpful and offered staff support.   Roles and responsibilities were unclear and staff were unsure what they were accountable for. The culture of the service was not a positive one and staff lacked time, knowledge and understanding. Observations during our inspection showed there was no effective leadership. The care supervisor/home manager informed us  that they had  limited communication with the provider and were yet to meet them to discuss the progress  of the service.    We found the service to be continually failing to ensure that there were robust systems in place for effective  oversight and governance, to ensure people were living in a safe environment, supported by adequate  numbers of staff, competent in their roles and deployed in a way which met people's needs effectively. The  provider and care supervisor had not been proactive in checking that improvements were being made and  were largely left unaccountable whilst placing the blame with the failure of previous manager; this included  those responsible for oversight of quality and training.   Quality assurance systems and processes which assessed, monitored or improved the quality of the service  were not effective or established. The provider and manager could not evidence any effective systems or  processes which assessed, monitored or mitigated the risks relating to the health, safety and welfare of  people using the service. The provider and care supervisor/home manager was unable to demonstrate how  they continually analysed, evaluated and sought to improve their governance and auditing practices in line  with their own quality assurance policy.  Records relating to staff employed and people who used the service were not properly maintained. This   16 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  related to staff training, induction and supervision. Where an internal audit and areas for improvement had  been highlighted, the provider and care supervisor failed to demonstrate that actions needed had been  completed or whether they required to be followed-up further. For example, the audit in December 2016  highlighted that care plans for people newly admitted to the service required completion and risk  assessments required review. Our evidence at this inspection on 10 July 2017 showed that these remained  outstanding and had not been completed. The provider did not have an effective system in place to review  staffing levels to ensure that the deployment of staff was suitable to meet people's needs. It was apparent  from our inspection that the absence of robust quality monitoring was a contributory factor to the failure of  the provider to recognise breaches or any risk of breaches with regulatory requirements sooner.   Support and resources needed to run the service were not available and the provider was not operating the  service in line with their own philosophy of care which stated that, 'Our belief in caring for the elderly is to  maintain the highest standards of quality care. Our abiding personal and professional concern is  safeguarding the interest and well-being of all residents as well as offering person-centred care.'   This is a breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014.  Since our inspection we have written to the provider highlighting several concerns we found and have  requested an action plan to be drafted, on how the service will improve care and treatment for people using  the service.  17 Whittingham House Inspection report 07 February 2018  This section is primarily information for the provider  Enforcement actions  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have taken enforcement action.

The Limes provides accommodation and support to a maximum of 46 older people some of whom were  living with dementia. It is not registered to provide nursing care. At the time of our inspection there were 44  people living in the home.  At the time of our inspection visit there was registered manager in post. A registered manager is a person  who has registered with the Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they  are 'registered persons'. Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  We last inspected this service on 13 and 14 June 2016 and found the provider was in breach of three  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. We issued  requirement notices in respect of these breaches.  Following our inspection in June 2016, the provider sent  us an action plan to tell us about the actions they were going to take to meet these regulations. They told us  they would be compliant  with two of the  regulations by September 2016 and with a further regulation by  November 2016.  We carried out this inspection to check if the improvements had been made in order to achieve compliance  with the regulations. At this inspection we found insufficient improvements had been made and governance arrangements in the home were not effective enough to rectify the breaches found at the previous  inspection. The provider was still in breach of regulations for: safe care and treatment, safeguarding service  users from abuse and improper treatment, and good governance. We found that there had been a  deterioration in the quality of care in other areas, which meant the provider was in breach of a further five  regulations of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This meant that  risks to people had increased.    Full information about CQC's regulatory response to any concerns found during inspections is added to  reports after any representations and appeals have been concluded.  We found people were not being provided with safe care. Risks to people's health and safety were not  always identified. We found in cases where risks had been identified, that insufficient action had been taken  to manage and mitigate the risk of any further harm. The systems in place had also not identified risks to  people from the premises. The service remained in breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People were not always protected from improper treatment and had been subject to inappropriate  restraint. Systems and processes in place were not effective to ensure people living in the home were  adequately protected from improper treatment. The service remained in breach of Regulation 13 of the   2 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Recruitment processes were not robust and did not fully mitigate the risks of employing staff unsuitable to  their role. The registered manager had not taken action to fully assure themselves that staff employed were  fit and proper.  This was a breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014.  Staff did not always understand the importance of seeking consent from people living in the home. The  service did not fully adhere to the mental capacity act which meant people's rights to provide consent were  not always fully protected.  This was a breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People's nutritional and hydration needs were not always met. People did not always receive adequate  support with their meals or access to suitable foods. This was a breach of Regulation 14 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  People were not always supported in a caring manner that promoted their dignity and independence.  People's privacy was not always respected. Their independence and ability to choose for themselves was  not always promoted.  This was a breach of Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014.  The care provided did not to take in to account people's individual needs and preferences. Staff did not  always support people to make their preferences known. Where preferences where known these were not  always acknowledged or provided for.  Care plans did not always contain sufficient information or guidance, including on how people wanted to be cared for. The activities on offer did not always meet people's  individual needs which meant they were not always inclusive. This was a breach of Regulation 9 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.   The provider had failed to implement effective systems to assess, monitor and improve the quality and  safety of the service. This had resulted in some people experiencing poor care and support. They had also  failed to maintain an accurate and complete record in respect of each person who used the service.  Necessary improvements to the service had not been made. The culture in the home was not always person  centred or respectful. This had not been identified by the provider or management in the service and  consequently improvements in this area were required. The service remained in breach of Regulation 17 of  the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  Improvements were required in the safe management of medicines. We found systems in place were not  always effective at ensuring people received medicines that were appropriate to their needs. Guidance for  'as required' medicines did not provide adequate guidance for staff regarding when this should be  administered.   Staffing levels appeared adequate in the home, although we observed that staff could be better deployed to help ensure people's needs were fully met.   There was varied feedback regarding the competency and expertise of the staff. Staff training was in place  although not all staff had attended this training, and training rates for some individual staff members were  very low.    People could access their local GP however we found staff did not always advocate on behalf of people to   3 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  access other health care services.   There was mixed feedback regarding how the service responded to complaints, although where complaints  were recorded we saw the manager had investigated and responded.   The overall rating for this service is 'Inadequate' and the service is therefore in 'Special measures'. Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months. The  expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant  improvements within this timeframe.  If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any  key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of  preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve. This service will continue to be kept  under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another  inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is  still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from  operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their  registration.  For adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  4 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  Inadequate    Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    Requires Improvement    	  The service was not safe.  Risks to people's wellbeing and safety were not always identified  and actions to minimise risks were not always taken.  People were not always protected from improper treatment and  had been subject to inappropriate restraint.  Recruitment processes were not robust and did not fully mitigate the risks of employing staff unsuitable to their role.  	  The service was not always effective.   Not all staff had not received sufficient training to ensure they  could meet the needs of people living in the home.  The home was not working within the requirements of the MCA.  Staff did not always seek people's consent.  People were not adequately supported with their nutritional  needs.  	  The service was not always caring.  Staff did not always interact with people in a caring manner.  People's dignity and privacy was not always promoted.   	  The service was not always responsive.  The care provided did not always meet people's individual needs and preferences, including the provision of activities.   Care records did not provide sufficient guidance to staff to help  ensure the care provided was person centred.  5 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Inadequate    	  The service was not well led.  There were widespread and significant shortfalls in the way that  the service was being managed.  Whilst there were some systems in place to monitor the quality of the service, these were not effective.  The culture in the home was not always person centred or  respectful.  6 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017     The Limes  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection checked whether the provider is meeting the legal requirements and  regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall quality of the service,  and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  This inspection took place on 25 and 26 July 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was carried out by  two inspectors and an expert by experience. An expert by experience is a person who has personal  experience of using or caring for someone who uses this type of care service.   Before we carried out the inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service. This included  statutory notifications that the provider had sent us. A statutory notification contains information about  significant events that affect people's safety, which the provider is required to send to us by law. We also  contacted the local authority adult safeguarding team and the quality assurance team for their views on the  service. We looked at the action plan the provider had sent us after their last inspection.  During our inspection we spoke with five people using the service and eight relatives of people using the  service. We spoke with seven members of staff. This included the registered manager, deputy manager, two  care staff, two senior members of care staff, and a kitchen assistant.   Not everyone living at The Limes was able to speak with us and tell us about their experiences of living in the home. We observed how care and support was provided to people and how people were supported to eat  their lunch time meal.  We looked at nine people's care records, three staff recruitment files and staff training records. We checked  the medicines records for eight people. We looked at quality monitoring documents, accident and incident  records, and other records relating to the management of the service.  7 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our previous inspection on 13 and 14 June 2016 we identified a breach Regulation 12 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This was because risks were not always  identified and action was not always taken to keep people safe. At this inspection on 25 and 26 July 2017 we  found sufficient improvements had not been made and additional concerns were identified.   Risks to people had not always been identified and managed appropriately. Two people living in the home  required specialised diets because they were at risk of choking. Food records for one person showed that  staff had failed to provide foods that were suitable for their needs and meant there was an increased risk of  harm to the person. For another person on the first day of our inspection visit we saw they were given a  dessert that was not suitable and they started to experience difficulties while eating this. We intervened to  ensure the person did not eat any more of this dessert and asked the registered manager to respond  urgently to this risk. For a third person we found they had been experiencing unstable diabetes and  sufficient actions had not been taken to assess and manage this risk. For a fourth person, we found they had been consistently refusing their medicines over a three week period and sufficient actions had not been  taken to assess and manage this risk.   At this inspection we also found sufficient and timely actions were not taken to ensure people who were  nutritionally at risk were safe. For one person, records showed they had lost 2.8kg between 31 March 2017  and 30 June 2017. Food charts were completed between 29 June and 1 July 2017 which showed the person  was eating very little. No additional actions to assess or manage this risk, such as an increased monitoring of this person's weight loss, food intake, or referral to a dietician had taken place. For a second person we saw  they had lost 4.2kg between the 16 June 2017 and 24 July 2017. Whilst the service had taken some action to  respond to this risk, such as requesting referrals to a dietician. We found that their three day food chart from  6 July 2017 to 8 July 2017 showed they were eating small amounts and this was discontinued despite the  person being assessed at a high risk of malnutrition. This meant staff could not sufficiently monitor and  respond to this risk.   Risks to people from deterioration of their skin conditions were not adequately monitored or managed. We  found that for two people at high risk of pressure sores, regular repositioning as detailed in their associated  risk assessments was not taking place as frequently as required. We observed one of these people sitting in  the lounge for long periods of time without the required repositioning taking place. A third person's risk  assessment stated they required support with repositioning every three hours at night. The registered  manager was unable to provide us with any documentation showing this was taking place. This meant no  monitoring of the person's repositioning was taking place so that the level of risk could be adequately  assessed. Staff we spoke with did not always demonstrate full understanding of this risk and how to manage it.   Risk assessments did not always identify risks or provide staff with sufficient guidance. For example, in  relation to the management of people's diabetes, required specialist diets and the risks of choking, and non- compliance with medicines.   8 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  There was a system in place for the reporting and analysis of accidents and incidents that occurred in the  service. However, we found this was not always effective and did not always ensure satisfactory actions had  been taken in response to identified risks. For example, we saw one person had fallen three times in June  2017. The registered manager had recorded that in response to this risk a referral to a falls clinic and  occupational therapy had been made. However, there was no evidence that these referrals had been made.  We asked the registered manager and deputy manager about this who told us they had experienced  difficulties making these referrals and were unable to confirm that these had been made. This meant we  were concerned that the identified action to manage this risk had not been taken.   At our last inspection in June 2016 we found some risks to people from the premises were not adequately  managed or risk assessed. Whilst we saw regular health and safety checks were now being carried out, we  found there was a continued risk relating to the management of the premises. On the first day of our  inspection visit we found people had access to the garden of the home where a shed had been left open  with tools and paint, and other equipment that posed a risk to people's safety. Records showed that cold  water temperatures in the home were above the recommended range which meant there was an increased  risk of legionnaire bacteria growing. This risk had not been sufficiently identified and suitable action to  address this risk had not been taken.   The above information meant the provider continued to be in breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and  Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.   At our previous inspection carried out in June 2016, we found that the provider was in breach of Regulation  13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. This was because there  was a lack of systems and staff understanding to ensure safeguarding incidents were identified and reported to the local authority safeguarding team as required. At this inspection we found whilst improvements in  reporting safeguarding incidents had been made, continued concerns remained.  During our inspection visit we witnessed two incidents where people living in the home were subject to  improper treatment which included a disproportionate use of control and restraint. There was at least one  other staff member present during this incident but they did not intervene. We reported this incident to the  registered manager during the inspection and they were not aware this incident had taken place, or aware  of any other concerns in the service regarding improper treatment or restraint. This meant we were  concerned that the systems and processes in place were not effective and people living in the home were  not adequately protected from improper treatment. Therefore the provider remained in breach of  Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.  At this inspection in July 2017 we identified a breach of Regulation 19 of (Regulated Activities) Regulations  2014. This was because the recruitment processes in place were not robust and did not fully mitigate the  risks of employing staff unsuitable to their role.   We found where issues had been raised through recruitments checks no risk assessments had been carried  out to ensure that staff employed were of fit and proper character.     We found improvements were required in the safe management of medicines. Records for one person  showed staff had administered a medicine they were allergic to and this had impacted on their health.  Whilst the registered manager had taken action in response to this we were concerned that staff practice in  the home had allowed this to occur. For another person we saw they had been administered a medicine  that they were unable to take due to swallowing difficulties. Whilst staff had subsequently taken action, we  were concerned that the actions they had taken had not sufficiently explored the risk to the person and had   9 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  meant that the medicine was administered covertly with no thorough consideration and consultation in  place.   People's medicine administration records showed medicines were administered as prescribed and were  stored safely and securely. One of the medicine administration records we checked did not have available  written information to show staff how and when to administer as required medication. We found for other  people this information was in place but did not always contain sufficient guidance for staff on when to  administer these medicines. We checked three medicines and saw the stock count was accurate.  People told us they received their medicines when required.  One person said, ""I get my tablets in the  morning and the evening and they watch me take them."" Another person told us, ""They always make sure  that I get my tablets in the morning and at night.""   None of the people, relatives, or staff raised concerns about staffing levels in the home. One person said,  ""[Staff] are pretty good at turning up if I press my buzzer when I want something."" This person gave a  demonstration of this to us, pressing their call bell, with a member of staff responding promptly. A second  person told us, ""If [I] need any help then there is someone about to help me."" However, during our  inspection we observed that although there appeared to be sufficient staff they were not always deployed  effectively to ensure people were adequately supported, for example over the lunchtime period.   A staffing dependency tool was used to help the registered manager establish how many staff were required  to meet people's needs. We looked at this and saw it reviewed how many people had high dependency  needs in the home and involved asking people's and staff member's opinions of staffing levels in the home.  We reviewed the staffing rosters for the last two weeks and saw the home was staffed to the levels the  provider had deemed as required to meet people's needs.  10 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible.   People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this in their best interests  and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care home and hospitals are  called Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS). We checked whether the service was working within the  principles of the MCA and whether any conditions on authorisations to deprive a person of their liberty was  being met.  People and relatives we spoke with told us not all the staff asked for their consent before providing support.  One person said, ""Not all of them ask if it's alright to do things for me. Some do. I eat whatever I'm given as I  don't mind."" A second person told us, ""Some of the carers do ask if it's alright to do things for you, but not all of them. They have to do what they have got to do."" A relative said, ""Some of the staff ask [name's] consent  and some don't but understanding of the question is very limited.""  We saw that relatives were being asked to provide consent for people without staff checking that they had  the legal authority to do so. For example, we saw relatives were signing for consent to the service sharing  information about people. On another occasion we saw that family members had been advised that their  consent would be sought before staff took people out of the home on trips.   People had risk assessments in place that stated people did not have full capacity to make decisions about  their care, however there were no mental capacity assessments in place to support these risk assessments  and provide clarity regarding what specific decisions they could not make. We found for one person a  mental capacity assessment had been made that they lacked the capacity to make decisions regarding their diet. Records showed that actions had been taken to restrict the person's diet however we later received  conflicting information from the provider that the person had capacity in regards to their diet. We spoke  with this person who told us they understood why the restrictions had been put in place but had not felt  involved or consulted about this decision. This meant we were not confident the home was fully adhering to  the MCA.   The registered manager had made applications for authorisations under DoLS. However, we found in the  home's development plan they had stated that all people with a diagnosis of dementia required an  application to be made. Having a diagnosis of dementia does not automatically mean a person lacks  capacity to consent and that an authorisation is required. Each person's circumstances must be assessed  and considered individually, including the individual's ability to consent.  We were concerned that this  blanket approach to applications demonstrated that the registered manager did not fully understand their  responsibilities under DoLS and applications for authorisations were being made without following the   11 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  proper legal processes and assessing if they were required.   The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.       People were not always supported with their nutritional and hydration needs. We observed during both  days of our visit that people in the home did not always have drinks readily available to them and were not  always supported to drink enough. We observed the support provided over lunch time and saw not all  people were supported adequately with their meals; as a consequence we observed some people did not  receive enough to eat. For one person we found they required nutritional supplements but their medicine  administration records showed these had been out of stock and had not been given for eleven days. This  meant the person had not received the right support to ensure their nutritional needs were met.  We also found that meals were not provided in a way that ensured people's nutritional needs or preferences  were met. For example, one person's care plan stated they preferred to eat using their fingers and for staff to  provide finger foods. We observed on the 25 July 2017 that the meal provided to the person was not finger  food and although they attempted to try to eat this with their fingers this was not possible. We reviewed the  food records for this person and saw they were consistently not provided with suitable finger foods. This  meant that they were at risk of not eating their meals. For a second person we saw their care plan and  associated risk assessment said to offer regular high calorie snacks. Their discharge letter from the local  nutrition and dietetics department advised they should have a small and frequent meal pattern. During our  inspection we observed regular high calorie snacks and a frequent meal pattern were not provided, which  meant their nutritional needs were not being met.  The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 14 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.       We received mixed comments about the food provided. One person told us, ""I'm very happy with the food I  get. I have no complaints about it."" Whilst another person said, ""The food could be much better, it's not  terribly appetizing. It needs to be more like home cooking."" Whilst some relatives we spoke with raised  concerns about the support their relatives received with their nutrition and hydration. One relative said, ""We  have concerns about [name's] food and fluid intake which we don't think is monitored properly. We bring in  more drinks."" Another relative told us, ""[Name] does not eat much or drink much. I try to help but they do  not want that they want to do it themselves. I have asked for help from a dietician, but I have not had any  feedback from them.""   People and relatives provided us with varied feedback regarding the competency and expertise of the staff.  One person told us, ""I think they know what they are doing."" Whilst another person said, ""Some know what  they are doing and some are not so well trained."" A third person told us that a new member of staff had  supported them with specific care task involving equipment which they had no experience of. They said the  member of staff was able to undertake this task with instruction from themselves. A relative told us, ""Some  of the staff know what they are doing and some don't.""   Staff we spoke with told us their training was up to date. One staff member told us it was, ""Always good to  refresh."" Staff told us training provided was via online courses and that it provided them with the  information they needed. However, from our conversations and findings from this inspection we were  concerned about how effective the training and systems in place were in order to ensure all staff had the  knowledge required to meet people's needs. For example, not all staff were able to tell us about the MCA  and some showed poor knowledge of the prevention of pressure ulcers.   12 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  Staff training records showed training rates for each topic that staff had training in, for example first aid or  fire safety, were over seventy percent in the majority of areas. However, it showed some individual staff  members had poor training rates. For example one staff member only had a training attendance rate of five  percent and another two staff were on seventeen percent. We reviewed the audits for training and found this issue did not appear to have been sufficiently identified and there was no clear plan in place to address this.  New staff told us they received an induction, which consisted of training and shadowing other experienced  staff prior to working in the home. One staff member told us, ""I was well prepared."" We saw there was a staff  induction checklist in place to ensure staff had been told about the care required and their responsibilities.   People told us they could access their local general practitioner. One person said, ""If I need the doctor I can  see one, but I very rarely require one."" Another person told us, ""I can see the doctor when I need to."" Whilst  records showed people were supported to access their local doctor we were not always confident that the  service was sufficiently advocating on people's behalf for access to other health care professionals, such as  speech and language therapists or falls specialists.  13 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were not always supported in a caring manner that promoted their dignity and independence.  During our visits we saw a number of incidents when staff did not act in a caring way. For example, we  observed the support provided over lunch time and saw staff standing over people when supporting them  to eat rather than sitting alongside them. We also observed staff assisting people with no acknowledgement  or interaction. On another occasion one staff member was assisting two people to eat at the same time. On  a fourth occasion we observed a staff member encouraging a person to drink a previously served hot drink  that had gone cold. We observed that staff member had noted the drink was cold but continued to  encourage the person to drink it, and did not offer a fresh drink.   One person was sitting in the communal lounge and we saw them sleeping on and off throughout the day.  We observed that they were often doubled over and slumped on the table in front of them, at one point with  their hair in their food, for long periods of time. Whilst staff were present in the communal lounge we noted  staff did not consistently respond to this person in order to support them to sit upright or offer them  assistance to their room so they could sleep comfortably. We noted that this compromised the person's  dignity.   We found people's privacy was not always respected, for instance we observed a staff member pulling up a  person's trousers and administering cream to their legs whilst in they were sitting in the communal lounge,  in full view of other people during their lunch time meal. They did not offer the opportunity for privacy,  compromising both privacy and dignity for the person.  People's independence and choices were not always promoted and respected. At lunchtime we noted that  one person was wearing a coloured plastic apron around their neck to protect their clothing. They  repeatedly tried to remove it during the meal. A staff member intervened and stopped the person from  doing this several times, tucking the protector in. We found that whilst the staff member's intentions may  have been to ensure the person kept clean this did not fully acknowledge or support their right to remove  the protector.    The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.        We received mixed feedback from people and relatives regarding how caring staff were. One person told us,  ""They look after me well here and they are all very nice."" Another person said, ""The majority treat me with  respect."" A third person told us, ""Some of the staff are caring and some are not so caring. The same applies  to the way they speak to you. Some are more respectful than others."" A relative said, ""There are some caring  staff here who work very hard, but there are not enough staff so they under a lot of pressure. Some of the  agency staff are not so good. The same applies to the way they speak with [name]. It is the way in which  things are missed."" Whilst a second relative told us, ""The care here is variable the permanent staff are more  caring and thoughtful, whereas the contract staff are less so. I needed to chase them over [name's] personal  care of their nails which were dirty. They said that was because [name] had had chocolate cake. They did   14 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  clean them, but even now [name's] nails are too long and need trimming. You do have to remind them to do things.""  15 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   The care provided did not to take in to account people's individual needs and preferences. We found  systems and staff did not fully support people to make their preferences known. For example, there was no  additional support in place, such as picture menus, for people to help them make decisions regarding what  they wanted to eat and to communicate this. We observed that without this support people struggled to  understand staff member's questions and make their preferences known. We observed on another occasion  a staff member provided a person with a hot drink without communicating with the person and asking them what they wanted.   We found actions were not always taken by staff or the management to ensure people's needs were met and reasonable adjustments made in order to promote people's independence.  We found one person required  additional support to regain their independence. There was no system in place to support this and records  did not show this support was being given. We asked the registered manager what support was being  provided by staff and were provided with conflicting answers regarding whose responsibility, staff or  relatives, this was.   We also found that people's previous preferences were not being considered when people had lost the  ability to recall and communicate what those preferences were. For example, foods that people had chosen  not to eat or did not like, such as meat, were given to them despite the fact they had previously not wanted  to eat such foods. People's pre admission assessment and care plans did not contain sufficient detail,  including what foods they did not like, in order to ensure these preferences were met.   The care plans we looked at did not always contain sufficient information or guidance, including on how  people wanted to be cared for. For example, in relation to refusals of medicines, diabetes, or behaviour that  others may find challenging. This meant staff did not have sufficient written guidance to meet people's  needs. It also meant that new or agency staff who did not have knowledge of people and their needs would  not have sufficient written guidance to meet people's needs in the event that permanent staff were not  available.   We observed that activities on offer during our inspection did not take in to account people's individual and  specific needs. The majority of people in the home were seated in two lounge areas for most of the day. We  saw most of the entertainment on offer was loud music being played whilst at the same time a television  was switched on and put on mute with subtitles. In the afternoon of one of our visits the activity on offer was a quiz. We observed this quiz and saw only two people were able to fully participate in this. We noted for  some people this had the potential to cause frustration and upset as some people were attempting to join in and answer the questions but were unable to do so due to the nature of their cognitive impairment.  The above information meant the service was in breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act  2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.        The majority of people and relatives we spoke with felt staff knew them well including their preferences,   16 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  although this was not consistently reported. One person said, ""I think they do know what I like and what I  don't like. I have been here a while and I think they know me by now."" Another person told us, ""They know  what I like and what I don't like and make sure I get it."" However, one person said, ""The activities are a bit  limited. The lady who does it tries her best but her time is limited and I don't think she fully understands the  type of people here. The loud music here kills conversation in the lounge, that's if there were people to  speak with."" Two relatives told us, ""We are not sure that they all know what [name] likes and does not like""  and ""I'm not sure they fully understand [name]. It's the little things that bother me like their nails and  making sure they are well fed and can get what they want.""  None of the people we spoke with were able to recall having recently been asked their opinion about their  care and preferences. One person told us, ""I think I filled a questionnaire in the past but I can't remember  when."" None of the relatives we spoke with could recall recent meetings to discuss and review their relatives  care needs, where appropriate. It was not always clear from looking at people's care records how much  input they and their relatives had in to formal care planning. However, most of the relatives we spoke with  confirmed they felt informally consulted and involved in their relatives care. Although one relative told us,  ""We don't feel that we are fully consulted on all the detail of [name's] care.""  Most people and relatives we spoke with told us they had no complaints and had not raised any. One person said, ""If I have any complaints then they soon see to it."" Although a relative we spoke with told us they did  not feel their concerns were always taken seriously and responded to. They said, ""We complain a number of  times about a number of things, particularly about [name's] safety and wellbeing but we feel that we have  not been listened to. We don't know if all our complaints are recorded and what response they say they have made to us."" We looked at the complaint records and could not see that the concerns raised by this relative  had been recorded and responded to. This meant we could not be certain that complaints were always  being noted and reported to the management team. However, we saw where complaints had been  recorded and reported to the registered manager they had responded appropriately in order to resolve  them.  17 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017   "	  Inadequate  	" during this inspection showed that the provider had failed to meet the regulations in respect to   18 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  safe care and treatment, safeguarding, the employment of fit and proper persons, nutritional and hydration  needs, dignity and care, consent, person centred care, and good governance. In addition, the provider had  consistently failed to sustain and make improvements where non-compliance and breaches of regulations  had been identified during previous inspections. This meant the provider had failed to take sufficient action  to maintain standards in the home and ensure the service was compliant with these regulations.  At our last inspection we found that the care records we looked at contained information about people's  care needs but these were not always sufficient, accurate, and up to date. The care records we looked  showed this continued to be a concern and action had not been taken to make sufficient improvements.  This meant the home did not have in place accurate, complete, and contemporaneous records of people's  care including guidance for staff on how to meet people's needs. This was of particular concern given some  of the staff working in the home were agency staff.  During our inspection on 25 and 26 July 2017 we observed a number of incidents that did not uphold  people's rights, dignity, and constituted improper treatment. We reported our concerns and observations to  the registered manager and deputy manager during our inspection. They were not aware of such incidents,  had not received reports from other staff, and felt this was not a normal occurrence. We were concerned  about there being a culture in the home which was not person centred or respectful and had not been  identified by management or staff working in the service.   We asked staff we spoke with how they knew what was expected of them on each shift and how they  understood their responsibilities. The staff we spoke with told us that staff worked together to decide which  tasks they completed. One staff member said, ""Everybody kind of knows without being told."" Our  observations during the inspection indicated this was not always effective. For example, we observed during lunch times staff swapping and changing roles with each other which impacted on the support people  received. This meant we were concerned there was a lack of leadership and direction in order to ensure staff understood their duties, carried these out, and were accountable for them.  Staff told us that the management team was supportive and approachable. One said, ""It's the sort of place if I went to [deputy manager] and said I'm not confident, they would help.""  Another staff member said the  management were, ""Supportive, helpful."" We saw there were regular staff meetings where staff had an  opportunity to discuss the service. One staff member told us, ""[Management] will always listen to what we've got to say.""   We saw there were also regular meetings for people living in the home and their families, where people were asked their feedback about the service. A recent quality assurance survey had been conducted with people  and their relatives to gain their views on the service. However, we were not sure how effective this model of  feedback was given they had been conducted with some people living in the home who had limited ability  to provide verbal feedback due to the nature of their cognitive impairments.  19 The Limes Inspection report 13 September 2017  "

At the end of the first day we  told the provider we would be returning the next day to continue with our inspection.  Carton House is a residential care service that is currently registered to provide housing and personal  support for up to 15 adults who have a range of needs including mental health and learning disabilities. At  the time of our inspection 11 people were using the service.  The service had a registered manager in post. A registered manager is a person who has registered with the  Care Quality Commission to manage the service. Like registered providers, they are 'registered persons'.  Registered persons have legal responsibility for meeting the requirements in the Health and Social Care Act  2008 and associated Regulations about how the service is run.  Previously, we carried out an unannounced comprehensive inspection of this service on 2 and 3 February  2016. A breach of legal requirement was found in relations to staff training. After the comprehensive  inspection, the provider wrote to us to say what they would do to meet legal requirements. We undertook a  focused inspection on 16 June 2016 and found the provider had met the legal requirements.  In March 2017 the Local Authority contacted us because they had concerns with health and safety issues at a neighbouring property which was also being used to accommodate people. They were also worried about  how the service treated people who lacked the capacity to make decisions about their care and treatment.   We undertook a focused inspection on the 23 March 2017. We had not been aware the provider was using  the neighbouring property. We found four breaches of legal requirements in relation to safety of the  premises and of people using the service, how people gave consent to care and records relating to this, how  the service was managed and a failure to notify the CQC of specific incidents. The provider was rated as  inadequate in two key questions, safe and well led. The provider sent us a plan to tell us about the actions  they were going to take to rectify each breach of the regulations. They told us these would be completed  between May and July 2017.   Following this inspection in March 2017 the CQC began to investigate concerns about the registration of  Carlton House. We were concerned the provider may not have been registered properly and may have been  providing care outside of our regulated activities. This meant we were unable to inspect the service to make  sure people were receiving the care they should have. We took action and met with the provider to make  sure they understood how serious the situation was. We asked them to provide us with information to clarify their registration position. During this period we worked with the local authority to ensure people remained  safe. The provider's registration is now correct and they are registered with us as a partnership. We carried  out this inspection in October 2017 to make sure the provider had met the legal requirements found during  our last visit. At this inspection in October 2017 the provider confirmed the neighbouring property was no  longer in use. We checked this during our visit. The provider is currently applying to reduce the number of   2 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  bed numbers at the service from15 to12 to reflect their existing position.   At this inspection, in October 2017, we found breaches in 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014 and one breach of the Care Quality Commission (Registration)  Regulations 2009. The breaches related to safe care and treatment, the need for consent, good governance,  safeguarding, person centred care, staffing, failure to display a rating, requirements relating to a registered  manager, premises and equipment and dignity and respect. The service continued to be in breach of the  four regulations found in March 2017.   We are considering what action we will take in relation to these breaches. Full information about the CQC's  regulatory response to any concerns found during inspections is added to reports after any representations  and appeals have been concluded.  Risk assessments and care plans continued to be out of date, some risks to people had not been identified,  including risks relating to the storage of cleaning materials. Where a risk had been noted little had been  done to reduce that risk.   The provider had changed the layout of the rooms and, one person had been moved to a room on the  ground floor that had previously been a staff sleep-in room. The room was very small and we were  concerned about the person being comfortable or maintaining a quality of life in this small space. The mix  and number of people using the service and the new layout of the rooms gave us concerns about the  number of toilets and bathing facilities available and accessible for people. Men and women used the  service and moving from floor to floor to use bath shower rooms and toilets impacted on people's dignity  and privacy.  Some important information was missing from people's medicine records. Staff did not always know how  people liked to take their medicine and there was no information to tell staff when 'as required' medicine  should be given. One person's medicine had not been recorded on their records properly so it was hard to  tell if they had been given their medicine or not.   Staff we spoke with knew about safeguarding people from abuse and neglect but we were concerned  because the provider had failed to report, act upon and investigate some incidents.  The service was not working within the requirements of the Mental Capacity Act (2005) and the Deprivation  of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) to help ensure people's rights were protected. Where decisions had been made in people's best interest, no mental capacity assessments had been carried out and there were no records of best interest meetings.  Staff did not always receive the appropriate support, training, supervision and appraisal to support them to  carry out their duties.  The provider did not always give people the necessary support in relation to eating and drinking. We were  concerned that two people's nutritional needs had not been assessed by healthcare professionals and the  support was not in place to make sure they received adequate nutrition or hydration.  People were relaxed in the company of staff and told us they were happy at the service. Staff appeared to  know people well although this knowledge was not reflected in people's care plans.  Activities at the service were limited for some people. People had activity plans but there was little evidence   3 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  of activities taking place.  The service was poorly led. Systems were not in place to identify health and safety issues that could put  people who used the service and staff at risk.   The registered manager failed to ensure care plans and risk assessments were up to date and accurate and  when people lacked capacity to make some decisions there were no checks in place to ensure the correct  legislation and guidance had been followed.   Our findings suggested the registered manager did not have the skills and competency to carry out her role.  We found that the registered manager had not told the CQC about important incidents that had occurred  concerning people who used the service, which we were required to know about by law so we can monitor  the service properly.   The service was not displaying its rating of performance from the last CQC inspection, as required by law.  The overall rating for this service is 'Inadequate' and the service is therefore in 'special measures'.  Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months.  The expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made  significant improvements within this timeframe. If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe  so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action in line with our  enforcement procedures to begin the process of preventing the provider from operating this service. This  will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they  do not improve. This service will continue to be kept under review and, if needed, could be escalated to  urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another inspection will be conducted within a further six  months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is still a rating of inadequate for any key question  or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling  their registration or to varying the terms of their registration.  For adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  4 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not safe. Some risks to people had not been  identified. Some risk assessments were out of date.  Some important information about people's medicine was not  recorded.  We were concerned safeguarding incidents were not always  reported or investigated appropriately.  The provider had effective staff recruitment and selection  processes in place and there were enough staff on duty to meet  people's needs.  Inadequate    	  Inadequate    The service was not effective. Some staff had not received  mandatory training and many staff members required refresher  training to keep their knowledge and skills up to date.  Supervision and appraisals were out of date.  The provider was not meeting its requirements under the Mental  Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) and the Deprivation of Liberty  Safeguards (DoLS) to help ensure people's rights were protected.  Some people received the support they needed to maintain  good health and wellbeing. Other people did not. Staff worked  well with some health and social care professionals but failed to  contact others.  People were not always protected from the risks of poor nutrition and dehydration.  	  Requires Improvement    Some aspects of the service were not caring. We could not see  how people were involved in making decisions about their care,  treatment and support.   The care records we viewed contained generic information with   5 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  little detail about what was important to people and how they  wanted to be supported.  Staff had a good knowledge of the people they were supporting.   The lay out of the building and facilities had an impact on  people's privacy and dignity.  	  Requires Improvement    Some aspects of the service were not responsive. Most people  did not have person centred care records some records were out  of date and others had not been reviewed.   Some important records relating to people's health care needs  were not always completed.  Some people were involved in activities they liked in the  community. There was very little for others, who were less  independent, to do.   	  Inadequate    The service was not well-led. There was a registered manager  who was supported by two deputy managers who managed the  day to day running of the service.   The quality assurance system in place did not identify issues with the service.  Information for people using the service was limited and  sometimes incorrect.   The service did not report on incidents as it was legally required  to do so. The registered manager had not kept up to day with  their skills and qualifications. Ratings from the previous CQC  inspection were not displayed.  6 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017     Carlton House  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  Before our inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service which included any statutory  notifications we had received in the last 12 months and spoke with one relative of a person using the service.  One inspector undertook the inspection which took place on 4, 5 and 9 October 2017 and was joined by a  second inspector on 5 October 2017. The first day was unannounced. At the end of the first day we told the  provider we would be returning to continue with our inspection.  We spoke with six people who used the service, a healthcare professional, a visiting hairdresser two staff  members, both deputy managers and the registered manager. We conducted observations throughout the  inspection. We looked at seven people's care records, three staff records and other documents which  related to the management of the service, such as training records and policies and procedures. After the  inspection we spoke with another two healthcare professionals and three relatives of people using the  service.  7 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our previous inspection we had concerns relating to health and safety issues at Carlton House and the  neighbouring property which at the time was being used to accommodate one person using the service.  Risks had not always been identified and assessments not regularly reviewed. The registered manager did  not do all that was reasonably practicable to reduce risks, and health and safety concerns were not always  recorded in people's care plans. Following the inspection the registered manager sent us an action plan to  detail how the service would meet its legal requirements. However, the registered manager did not  understand why they were not meeting this regulation and felt people were safe in the service.  During this inspection we found the service was no longer using the neighbouring house so the  environmental safety issues related to that property were no longer relevant. However, the registered  manager and the provider had not addressed all of the issues identified at our last inspection.  We found the risk to people had increased because the risks to people who used the service had still not  been fully identified, assessed or managed. This meant people were at risk from unsafe care and treatment.  One person had recently become aggressive while in the community. Records indicated there had been  several incidents of aggressive behaviour. Staff were able to explain their thoughts on why this had  happened and how they managed the risk by not allowing the person to watch violent DVD's as they had  found these could make them more aggressive. The person's risk assessment confirmed this and stated that they ""can harm others whilst in the home"" but there was no written risk management plan in place to guide  staff on how to manage the risk. We looked at other people's risk assessments who were at risk from this  person's behaviour but found this risk had not been identified so there was a danger that they could be  harmed because staff would not know what to do or look for signs and triggers. The deputy manager told us  they had not kept behavioural charts because they had not been asked to. So staff were unable to monitor  this person's behaviour.  The provider did not always review risk assessments annually, in accordance with their procedures so when  people's needs or risk changed there was no guidance to staff on how to manage this. So people may not  receive the care they need to keep them safe. For example, we found, one person's risk assessment was last  reviewed in 2015 and another in July 2016. Where people's risk assessments had been reviewed within the  last 12 months they did not always reflect the person's current needs. Two people were receiving a soft diet,  however, we could not find a risk assessment explaining why they needed a soft diet or what staff needed to  do to support the person to minimise the risk of choking. Another person's risk assessment was reviewed in  June 2017 but had not been updated to reflect their needs. For example, the risk assessment spoke about  shopping in the community but the person no longer went outside and stayed in bed most days. The same  person required two staff members to move and transfer them and the person was at an increased risk of  pressure ulcers. There were no risk assessments for this person's mobility needs or for their skin integrity. So  there was no information for staff on how to transfer safely or reduce the risk of pressure ulcers. The deputy  manager told us what they did to keep this person safe and help reduce risk but we could not see how other  staff would know when the information was not recorded. The deputy manager later showed us some hand  written notes they had made with guidance for staff on how to care for this person and told us they would   8 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  incorporate these notes into the persons care records.   Peoples individual risks were not always identified so staff did not have the information they needed to keep people safe. The provider did not always ensure risk assessments were specific to individuals. Risk  management plans had been copied for different people. For example, two people had identical risk  assessments for ""Feeling angry and upset"". One person's assessment for risks relating to hot weather  inappropriately referred to another person using the service on it. It was clear this document had been  copied from a different person's records instead of focusing on the individual risk for that person. The  provider had not provided staff with the training identified on people's risk assessments. For example, risk  assessments stated all staff must have positive behaviour support training and risk assessment training.  However, from records provided only one staff member had attended training in positive behaviour support  in 2011. There was no person centred information telling staff how they could support people as individuals  when they felt anxious or upset. There were no positive behavioural support plans in place to help staff  recognise triggers or situations that they needed to be aware of.   People were at risk from receiving unsafe care and treatment from staff working excessive hours. When we  looked at the staff rota we noted that at least two members of staff were working excessively long hours  without adequate breaks. For example, on eight occasions in September and October 2017 one staff  member worked a total of 23 hours in a 24 hour period, including waking nights. We looked at the rota going forward and noticed one of the deputies had also been rostered in to work 23 hours in a 24 hours period,  including a waking night on two occasions. We expressed our concerns that staff may be too tired after  working these long shifts to provide safe care to people. The registered manager told us staff were allowed  an hour break to go outside and do what they needed to do before starting their next shift. However, we  found this would be insufficient to overcome tiredness from working a waking night followed by working the  next day or a day shift followed by a waking night.  The provider did not always store people's medicines safely. We looked at how the service managed  people's medicines to make sure processes were in place to ensure people's safety. Most people's  medicines were stored appropriately in a locked secure cabinet. However, we saw one person had  prescribed creams in their bedroom which were freely accessible to any other person who entered the room. This was a risk to others who may try to use or swallow this medicine. We asked the registered manager if  the risk to others had been identified, they did not think it had and didn't seem sure, they removed the  creams from the room. On day three of our inspection we noticed the creams were back in the person's  room and again easily accessible to anyone who waked past the open door. We checked people's care plans but could not see any risk assessment in place for them concerning risks relating to this type of medicine.  We discussed or concerns with the registered manager and the deputy manager and they told us they were  looking at fitting a secure cabinet to the person's bedroom wall to keep the medicine safe.  People were at risk of receiving too much medicine or of not receiving the medicine they needed because  the provider could not always account for missing medicines. Most medicine administration record sheets  we looked at were fully completed with a weekly stocktake conducted by one of the deputy managers.  However, one person's 'as required' medicine was not correctly recorded so there was a risk that person  may have the incorrect dose of medicine at the wrong time. We counted the medicine remaining and three  tablets were unaccounted for. Staff were unable to tell us why. Later in the inspection staff told they had  identified when the tablets were given, however, this only accounted for one of the missing tablets and there was no record of when the other two tablets had been given.   People's medicines preferences and risks associated to the medicine they were taking were not  documented. This meant staff may have been unaware of how to safely give medicines to people or know   9 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  how people liked to receive their medicine. The deputy manager knew how people liked to take their  medicine and what to do if people refused their medicine, however, there was no written guidance available  to staff. For example, the deputy manager told us and medicine records confirmed that one person often  refused their medicine because they did not like the taste of one tablet; we were told if staff offered tablets  in a different order the person would be more likely to take them. Another person could only take medicine  in a liquid form and another person was prescribed a drug that prevented them from having certain food or  drink. Although staff knew this information it had not been written down so there was a risk that people may not receive their medicine safely.  There was no guidance available to support staff to administer PRN or 'as required' medicine as the  prescriber intended. This should include information such as, how much medicine should be given, signs to  look out for and when to offer the medicine, including verbal and non-verbal cues and if there are any  alternatives to PRN. Without this information staff may offer PRN inappropriately or fail to give PRN when  people needed it.  Not all staff received regular medicine management competency checks to ensure their skills and  knowledge were up to date. The deputy manager explained only those staff who had received regular  training in medicines management were able to administer people's medicines and refresher training was  provided every two years. In between training the deputy manager explained that regular competency  checks were completed to ensure staff handled people's medicine safely but they confirmed these were not  formally recorded so we could not verify that these had been completed, the timescales involved and what,  if any, issues had been identified. The service had a policy and procedure in place detailing the need for  recording staff competence in medicine management. The registered manager agreed they would start  putting this into practice in line with their own polices.   These concerns constituted a continued breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Safe Care and Treatment.  We were concerned that some of the people who used the service may not be safe as some strong cleaning  chemicals were easily accessible to them. We noted most cleaning chemicals for the service, were stored  and locked in the laundry room and the cellar. However, we also found cleaning fluids accessible to people  in various parts of the premises. When we raised these issues with the registered manager they did not  appear to share our concerns about the risk to people but they did remove the products and asked staff to  lock them away. We also noticed the cupboard in the first floor bathroom was unlocked. This contained the  hot water cylinder and pipework that was hot, we asked the registered manager to lock the cupboard as  there was a risk of people burning themselves.  We looked at the room layout and facilities available as the provider had moved people to different  bedrooms to accommodate the person that previously lived in the neighbouring property. We found people  were not always cared for in an environment that supported them to stay safe and met their needs. We  looked around Carlton House to ensure adequate support facilities and amenities were provided. There  were a total of 10 bedrooms, two of these were double rooms with a view of accommodating 12 people in  total. The ground floor had two single rooms and one double room, currently being used by two people who had apparently shared for many years and were happy to do so. We were concerned about the size of one  bedroom as it did not provide enough usable floor space for the person to be comfortable and maintain a  quality of life. We could not speak to the person because they were very anxious at the time of the  inspection. Staff told us the person had moved fairly recently from a larger room but they were not sure if  the move had caused anxiety. We asked the provider to give us the room measurements and after the  inspection they confirmed it was 358 cm by 190 cm or 6.8 square meters. This is far lower than the national   10 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  standards of 10 square meters for existing care homes as laid down by the Department of Health's National  Minimum Standards.   We were concerned that there was lack of toilets and bathing facilities in the building to accommodate the  needs of people using the service. The ground floor had the only shower room with toilet at the service. We  were told by staff that this was used by all 11 people when they wanted a shower instead of a bath. This was  also the only toilet for the four people who lived on the ground floor and for those who were using the  lounge during waking hours.   The second floor had a single room, a small kitchenette and a small flat with a small dining room, a settee, a  single bedroom and a bathroom with toilet. We were worried about the person in the single room on the  second floor as they would need to descend the stairs to use the toilet and bathroom on the first floor and  we did not consider this was safe. The registered manager explained that this person could use the  bathroom in the flat on the same floor and did not recognise this as a safety issue. The layout of the chairs  and tables in the lounge/ dining room appeared cluttered and did not allow for many people to sit  comfortably and for example, to watch the television. There were two dining room tables but not enough  chairs or space for everyone to eat a meal together if they wanted to.   Five people were on the first floor accommodated by four single rooms and one double room. One of the  single rooms had its own toilet and there was a separate toilet for communal use but all of the rooms shared one bathroom.  The exterior of the building and surrounding gardens were adequately maintained to keep people safe.  However, the internal décor needed modernising. The bathrooms on the first and second floor needed  updating. The first floor bathroom had a bath chair so people were able to sit while bathing, but there were  no shower attachments, only a plastic jug for pouring water so it was hard to see how staff could assist  people adequately while bathing.  These concerns amounted to a breach in Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Premises and equipment.  Systems and processes did not always protect people from potential abuse and neglect. Three relative's we  spoke with felt their relatives were safe and their family member enjoyed living at the home. We heard how  one family had provided a mobile phone to their relative so they could phone when they were out and  about and keep in touch with them and the service. However, a fourth relative explained they had concerns  about the safety of their relative and described an incident with another service user verbally threatening  their relative. They also told us of another example where one person had threatened their relative with a  knife. The person's relative said, ""They [the manager] told us they would move [the person who was  exhibiting threatening behaviour] but they haven't."" We saw an incident report had been completed with a  note that it had been reported to the local safeguarding authority and details that one to one support  should be provided. However, we did not see provision on the duty rota for one to one support. The  registered manager wrote to us after the inspection to explain that the person had mostly remained in their  room so did not receive one to one support during our visit. We did not see any investigation report or action taken to help staff manage the person's behaviour when it challenged the service or the systems in place to  protect those people at risk.   Generally staff we spoke with were aware of their responsibilities to keep people safe and report any  allegations of abuse or concerns about people's safety and there was information in communal areas for  people to follow if they had concerns and we saw safeguarding was an agenda item at staff and resident   11 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  meetings. However we did not find any robust procedures in place to record, report and act on safeguarding concerns.  We noted several incidents had been reported in the past to the local safeguarding authority. The CQC had  not received any statutory notifications regarding these incidents so we had been unable to monitor the  significance of each event and what the provider had done to reduce risk and protect people. This is  discussed more in the well led section of the report.   During our inspection we became concerned about two people who used the service. We were concerned  about their health and that staff had not acted quickly enough to ensure healthcare professionals had  assessed their condition. We spoke to staff about our concerns and we reported our findings to the local  safeguarding authority so they could investigate. Although the service had a policy in place for protecting  people we had no assurance that systems and processes were in place to thoroughly investigate and  immediately act upon any allegation or evidence of abuse.  These concerns constituted a continued breach of Regulation 13 of the Health and Social care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Safeguarding service users from abuse and improper treatment.  There were sufficient numbers of staff on duty to meet people's basic needs. On the day of our inspection we were told there were four staff on duty in the morning, three in the afternoon and nights were covered by  one waking and one sleeping staff member.   The service followed appropriate recruitment practices to keep people safe. Staff files contained a checklist  which clearly identified all the pre-employment checks the provider had conducted in respect of these  individuals. This included an up to date criminal records check, at least two satisfactory references from  previous employers, photographic proof of their identity, a completed job application form, a health  declaration, full employment history, interview questions and answers, and proof of eligibility to work in the  UK.  12 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our last inspection in March 2017 we found the provider had not carried out a mental capacity  assessment in relation to the use of bed rails for one person when staff had told us they lacked capacity to  consent to this. The provider had no records of best interest meetings having taken place in relation to the  decision to provide bed rails to this person. The service had failed to comply with the Mental Capacity Act  2005 (MCA) and this was a breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Following our inspection an action plan was submitted by the provider, this  detailed how the service planned to meet their legal requirements. The timeframe given by the provider to  complete these actions was July 2017.    The Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) provides a legal framework for making particular decisions on behalf of  people who may lack the mental capacity to do so for themselves. The Act requires that as far as possible  people make their own decisions and are helped to do so when needed. When they lack mental capacity to  take particular decisions, any made on their behalf must be in their best interests and as least restrictive as  possible. People can only be deprived of their liberty to receive care and treatment when this is in their best  interests and legally authorised under the MCA. The application procedures for this in care homes and  hospitals are called the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS).  During this inspection we found the provider had still failed to assess the capacity of people to make  decisions relating to their care. People lacking capacity were at risk of being restricted of their liberties  unlawfully. The registered manager told us they had made a blanket DoLS application to the local authority  for everyone living in the service, even though some people required no restrictions on their movement to  keep them safe. At the time of our inspection the local authority had not assessed the applications.   We observed three people were using bed rails but records did not tell us if people had consented to  bedrails or if the decision had been made on their behalf because they lacked capacity. The deputy  manager told us that one person had fluctuating capacity and would sometimes refuse treatment that was  important for them. Staff explained that they knew the signs when the person was liable to refuse treatment  and what to do in this situation. However, when we looked at the person's care records there was no  information about the person's capacity to make decisions about their care and no records of the person  ever refusing treatment. There was no written information to guide staff on what signs to look out for or  what they should do if the person's capacity fluctuated and they were unable to give their consent to  treatment. This meant there was a risk the person may not receive the support they needed when they  needed it. The provider had detailed a policy and procedure in place from 2016 giving guidance on what the  service need to do to meet the requirements of the MCA but this had not been actioned.   These concerns constituted a continued breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. Need for Consent.  Staff did not always receive the training they needed or refresher training to give them the necessary skills  and knowledge to meet people's needs effectively. Many staff required refresher training as previous courses  13 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  had expired. This was highlighted at our last comprehensive inspection in June 2016. During this inspection  we asked to see the records kept by the registered manager to ensure staff had received their training and  that refresher training was kept up to date. We were told this information was out of date and we gave the  provider the opportunity to provide us with updated information. The deputy manager also told us of the  training due be completed with the Local Authority and this included deprivation of liberty safeguards,  person centred care, dementia and infection control.   We looked at the updated training matrix and found there were three staff members had received little  training. For example, the matrix showed these staff had not received manual handling, fire safety and  awareness, first aid, infection control, dementia, safeguarding and nutrition. After the inspection the  registered manager wrote to us to tell us four staff members had started to work at the service less than two  months previously and had been booked to attend the Local Authority training. However, other staff had not completed refresher training in the timescales required by the provider in areas including fire safety, first aid, safeguarding, dementia, MCA, nutrition, falls and dignity, amongst others. We were concerned because  without updated skills and knowledge in key areas there was a risk that people may not receive safe and  appropriate care and support.   Staff did not receive the appropriate support needed to carry out their duties. Staff told us they felt  supported by their manager but we found supervisions were irregular and annual appraisals had not been  completed. It was hard to see how the service made sure staff had the knowledge, skills and experience to  deliver effective care and support. The registered manager told us staff had supervision ""quite often"" and  the deputy manager confirmed this should be at least every two months. They explained they had a matrix  for recording supervision but this had not been used yet. Staff thought they had received supervision but  when we looked at records we found these had not been completed in line with the provider's  requirements. We found no records of annual appraisals.   The issues above were a breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Staffing.  People did not always receive a choice of food. People appeared to enjoy the food they were given. One  person told us, ""The food is not bad…I'm not sure what we've got today but the portions are too big."" The  menu was displayed but did not provide people with a choice or correspond with the meals offered by staff  during our inspection. We observed the lunchtime experience for people during the three days of our  inspection. People were served their meals with no choice given as to the food or quantities being provided.  We saw one person was served their lunch in a plastic box as they came down the stairs. We asked a staff  member and the registered manager why that was but they were unable to give an explanation or evidence  this was the person's preference for eating their meals. On day three of our inspection, one person said to  the registered manager, ""If you haven't got enough to go round, can I have just veg please?"" There was no  further communication with the person to give assurance that there was plenty of food to go around or to  offer alternatives.  People were at risk of eating food that may be unsafe. In the fridge, some food items had expired or not  been labelled after opening. This was not in line with food safety guidelines and could place people at risk.  We saw there was limited food available for people if they wanted snacks outside of mealtimes and were  hungry. Food safety refresher training was out of date for nine staff members. So they may not have the  updated knowledge and skills needed to prepare and serve food in a safe way. Following our feedback on  their third day of our inspection we found additional food was in the fridge and opened items had been  labelled according to their opening date.   14 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  We saw examples where people were supported to have access to healthcare services and observed staff  supporting people to attend GP appointments during our inspection. We saw that the service was working  with the local hospice to help them care for one person that was nearing their end of life. A healthcare  professional told us they felt they had a good relationship with the service and that the deputy managers  listened and reacted to their advice. However, we looked at four people's care records and found there was  no contact with health care professionals when their physical or mental health care needs changed. For  example, following one incident, the service had requested help in July 2017 from one healthcare  department but had been asked to go to another service first for an assessment. When we asked if this had  been done we were told by the deputy manager that they didn't think so and we witnessed them making  enquiries for further information, during our inspection. Another person was very upset and anxious but staff did not know if that person was still registered with their psychiatrist or had been discharged. We were  concerned because the service was caring for people with varied and complex health conditions and  although contact with some healthcare professions was good there was a delay in other areas, this meant  people may not receive the care and support they needed when they needed it.   People had hospital passports in place, these documents are used to take to hospital or healthcare  appointments to show staff how they like to be looked after. However, we saw at least two examples where  information was vague and had not been updated to reflect people's needs. We spoke with the deputy  manager about this and they assured us they would update these documents as soon as possible.  The issues above relate to a breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Good Governance  15 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   The service cared for men and women of different ages and needs and provider had not considered how to  adequately maintain people's privacy when using bathrooms and shower rooms on different floors. On the  ground floor we observed the window of the wet room was clear glass and people's privacy may have been  compromised when they were using the facilities. We spoke to the registered manager about this who told  us there should be curtains. On the third day of our inspection the registered manager had put obscure glass in to give people privacy. The ground floor being used by four people accommodated by two singe rooms  and one double room. The double room had a privacy curtain was in place to be used to maintain people's  dignity. Staff told us the people sharing were happy to do so. However, we did not see evidence in their care  records to confirm this. On the first floor there were five rooms one with a separate toilet. People shared the  communal toilet and bathroom. The second floor contained a flat with its own bathroom and dining area  and single room and another single bedroom was on the same floor. We were concerned that the number of facilities available to people did not give them the dignity and privacy they may have needed. We did not see the individual privacy needs or choices of people recorded in their care records.  These concerns amounted to a breach in Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Dignity and Respect.  When we asked one person if they liked living at Carlton House, they smiled and told us, ""I'm ok"". Another  said ""I'm happy living here. The staff are kind."" We spoke with one person who told us about their birthday  party the previous weekend, they said, ""We had cake, it was good."" Relatives told us, ""Staff are very good to  [my relative]"", ""Carlton house is the only place that have provided [my relative] with a lifeline when other  homes gave up on [them]…they have taken the time to understand [them] as a person"" and ""On the face of  it all the staff are very pleasant."" We spoke to the hairdresser who was visiting the service, they told us ""It's  like a family really, it's really lovely…the staff and everyone.""   We observed interaction between staff and people using the service was warm and relaxed. People were  comfortable and at ease. Staff were patient when supporting people and responded quickly to people's  requests. Staff knew people well and were able to tell us about people's individual needs, preferences and  personalities. For example, one staff member explained the things one person liked to talk about and how it  made them feel less anxious. However, very little of this valuable information had been written down so it  was hard for new member of staff to get to know people and how they liked to be supported.  When people returned from their various activities they spoke to staff about their day and what they had  done. We saw one person liked to go to the shops and would talk to staff about what they wanted to buy.  Another person was talking to staff about their collage course and why did no longer wanted to attend on  one day. However, for those people who remained at the service, we saw little activity taking place and little  choice offered in how people had their leisure and social needs met. We saw that interactions were often  brief and functional. Most people spent the day in front of the television or in their rooms. When we spoke to  staff they explained this was people's choice and they did not want to go out. However, we did not see  evidence to support this in people's care plans and when we spoke to one person they told us how much   16 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  they would enjoy an outing.  People were not always able to tell us if they were offered choice in their day to day routines. However, we  observed that those who were able to left and returned to the service independently. People at the service  appeared to be able to go to bed when they wished and get up when they wanted to. During our lunch time  we did not see that people had a choice of main meal but staff appeared to already know what people liked  and didn't like, although this was not always written down. The majority of interactions between staff and  people using the service during lunch were brief and task orientated and did not positively impact on  people's wellbeing. For example, lunch was served to people with little engagement or conversation .One  staff member started to use their fingers to serve one person's food, we did not know if this was normal  practice or if the staff member was nervous. One person who refused their meal was offered a sandwich  which they accepted.   We saw that some people had made advance decisions about their end of life care, the deputy manager  explained how after attending one person's funeral people had been prepared to talk about their end of life  wishes and she had recorded these. One person was receiving end of life care, we spoke with a healthcare  professional that was supporting and advising the service with the person's care, they felt staff were, ""Really  caring and obviously very fond of [the person].""   People were supported to maintain relationships with their family and friends. Relatives told us they visited  at any time and knew the staff team well.  17 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   People were at risk of receiving inappropriate care because their care needs were not always reviewed in a  timely way and staff did not have accurate information about how to support their individual needs. There  was no evidence that the daily notes or handover records kept by staff were being used to inform regular  evaluations of each person's care plan. People's care records were mostly reviewed yearly. However, we saw at least three examples where this had not happened. One person's risk assessment for personal care was  last reviewed in 2014 and did not show the persons current support needs. Another person had a special  diet because of health concerns but their care plan had not been updated to reflect this and was last  reviewed in July 2016. Staff told us one person was at risk of choking and needed a soft diet. The persons  care plan was last reviewed in November 2016 and held no information about the need for a soft diet or that  the person was at risk of choking. The deputy manager told us that records were often updated on the  computer, we asked to see the updated records but the new records could not be found. Staff we spoke with told us they would always go to the paper file for information. We were concerned because people's care  records held incorrect information and were out of date so staff did not always have the details they needed  to give people the right care.  Peoples care records were not always accurate and complete. One person who was unwell was being  treated by the district nurse for pressure ulcers, we saw the district nurse kept details of a wound care plan  and the person had specialist equipment in place to help reduce the risk of further injury. Staff told us they  turned the person regularly. However, when we looked at the persons turning charts we noticed they had  not been completed between 17 and 21 September 2017 and from 29 September 2017 onwards. We looked  to see if there was any information in this person's care plan about the personalised care needed. We saw a  health action plan mentioned using cream for ""the sores under my feet"" but we did not see written  information for the person's current condition. The deputy manager had made some hand written notes  detailing the person's needs and later in the inspection we saw these notes had been stored in the person's  care plan.   The issues above relate to a continued breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Good Governance.  Staff did not always have the time or resources to provide person centred care. We found the various  complex needs of people using service and the distribution of other duties such as cleaning and cooking  gave staff little time to provide person centred care for everyone using the service. The registered manager  and both deputies included themselves on the rota and during the inspection we observed they had little  time to fulfil their caring duties or the other important administrate tasks such as updating care records and  making referrals to other health professionals.   Not everyone was supported to follow their interests or take part in meaningful person centred social  activities. One relative told us, ""There is very little going on…no activities, no music…only the TV."" They told  us that sometimes the deputy would take people out and how much this was enjoyed by people but said  ""things don't seem to happen."" We observed those people who were able coming and going from the   18 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  service attending various day centres or GP and hospital appointments.  A visiting hairdresser told us they came in regularly to provide a hairdressing service and on the occasional  weekend to entertain people with Karaoke. They obviously knew people well and had built up a good  relationship with people. However, over the three days we were inspecting there appeared to be very little  else for people to do when they remained at the service. There were no planned activities and people either  watched television or stayed in their bedrooms. One person told us,"" I don't go our much because I'm not  good on my feet. I'd like to go shopping but haven't been out for a long time."" When we spoke with the  deputy and registered manager about the lack of activities for people they appeared surprised.   We were shown activity planners for people but when we compared the activity with the day of our  inspection the activity was not happening. Staff told us people did not want to do their planned actives  because they were feeling tired. This was not recorded anywhere so we looked at the daily notes for one  person to see what activities they normally did. Over a period of nine days they went outside once to visit the GP the rest of the time their activity was watching television or staying in the lounge. This person had  previously told us they liked to go out and staff confirmed this was the case. We looked at staff duty planners for five days, these named the staff on each shift and the activities people did. We saw that for two of the  days no activities were listed for anyone, a birthday party was the main event for everyone on another day.  The final two days noted people had gone to various day centres while the remaining people at the service  ""rested, relaxed and watched TV"". We were concerned that some people were not being supported to follow  their interests or take part in activities that were relevant and appropriate for them.   These concerns were a breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Person Centred Care.  People and their relatives did not always contribute to their planning of care and support. Relative views  were mixed when we asked about their involvement in their relatives care. Two relatives we spoke with told  us they had never been involved or asked to contribute to their relatives care plan and another two relatives  told they felt fully involved and were invited to attend regular care reviews. One relative spoke positively of  the service and told us how well staff knew their relative and were able to recognise and manage their  behaviour and defuse situations. They told us, ""There are three or four people in Carlton House with very  challenging behaviour, they will take people on when others give up on them."" Another relative had  observed how good staff were with people when they became angry or upset. They said ""Staff are amazing  with other people who can be a bit difficult, I couldn't fault them.""  Care records were sometimes signed by people using the service but there was little information to show  how they had been involved in their care development. Care records provided little information about  people's preferences or personal history. We saw evidence of keyworker meetings with some people,  however, there was no information to show that ideas or changes people had requested were actioned.  Although staff had a good knowledge of the people they were caring for we did not see any detailed written  guidance for staff on to how to communicate effectively and engage positively with individuals. The deputy  manager did show us some recent hand written notes they had made of the personal knowledge they had  about three people, their likes, dislikes, daily routines and how staff could support them. We discussed how  this good piece of work could be expanded across all people using the service and how this information  could be incorporated into people's care records so it was meaningful and useful to people and staff. Daily  handovers were completed as were daily notes of people's care. When we asked about people's care these  were often referred to and seemed to be the most up to date information available to staff.  19 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  Relatives we spoke with told us they had no need to make a complaint but they would complain to the  deputy managers if they needed to. We noted information for people on how to make a complaint was in  the service user guide and on the notice board in the reception area.  20 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   Following our last inspection the CQC began to investigate concerns about the registration of Carlton  House. The provider was registered with the Commission as a partnership but was operating as a Limited  company. We met with the provider to make sure they understood the situation and asked them to provide  us with information to clarify their registration position. We have now established the registration status is  correct and the provider is registered as a partnership.  At our last inspection in March 2017 we found health and safety issues had not been identified, risk  assessments and care plans had not been reviewed within the providers specified timeframe and were not  up to date or relevant. We found decisions made of behalf of a person who lacked capacity were not  recorded and there was no evidence to suggest these had been made in line with the requirements of the  Mental Capacity Act. Following this inspection the provider submitted and action plan detailing how the  service would meet their legal requirements. They told us this would be completed by July 2017.   During this inspection in October 2017 the provider confirmed the neighbouring property was no longer in  use and we checked this during our inspection. At the time of our inspection the provider was in the process  of applying to reduce the number of beds from 15 to12 to reflect the change in accommodation. Many of the health and safety risks identified in the neighbouring property were no longer relevant and we noted that  some health and safety checks at Carlton House such as hot water checks were now being completed on a  regular basis. However, we found other checks had not been completed. For example, weekly and monthly  deep cleaning schedules were out of date having last been completed in June 2017.   The provider had not taken enough steps to assess, monitor and improve the quality of the service. People's  care records continued to be out of date, inaccurate and irrelevant and people's mental capacity  assessments had not been completed. The registered manager showed us a yearly quality check completed  during August 2017. Notes had been completed, for example, ""some care plans need to be updated"" but  there was no information detailing where the evidence came from so we did not know what care plans the  registered manager was referring to and what updating was required. One person's pressure sore had been  identified as ""under control"", however, the next review date was August 2018 and we could not see how the  provider could monitor this situation in a safe way. There were no action plan in place and yearly reviews did not give an appropriate timeframe to make necessary improvements to the quality and safety of the service  for the people living there. The registered manager relied on her deputies to ensure records were complete  and correct and health and safety checks were completed.  Care records viewed were mostly standardised with duplication found in five of the care records we looked  at. Not all records were complete, accurate or fit for purpose. This meant that people may not always care or treatment that was personalised and specifically for them.  Information for people who used the service was limited, there was little evidence of how the registered  manager engaged with people to get their views on how the service was run and the how suggestions made  were acted upon. We were shown a copy of the most recent service user meeting minutes, this was held in   21 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  May 2017. There appeared to be little input from people and when people had made suggestions we did not  see how these had been actioned. People were not given the information they needed that was relevant to  where they lived. We were shown a copy of the service user guide and told this was given to people when  they first started to use the service. It gave important information about the service and what people should  expect. However, the document had been copied from another provider's guide and the old provider and  service names were still in place. The document was incorrect and spoke about a registered manager  applying to be registered with the CQC and completing a registered manager's award in addition to  receiving a higher diploma in care. This document was last reviewed on 22 September 2017. It was clear the  service user guide had not been updated and people were not given accurate information about where they  lived and who was caring for them.  There were limited systems in place for staff to discuss issues and influence the operation of the service. One staff member told us they felt involved in the development of the service but we couldn't see how staff  influence had effected change. We asked about staff meetings as these are often a good forum to exchange  ideas and improve the running of the service. We were told staff meetings should happen every other month. After our inspection the registered manager sent us minutes from the last two staff meetings, dated 3 March  2017 and 6 August 2017. We noted these had not occurred within the timescales suggested and the body of  the minutes were exactly the same, word for word, with no variation, staff ideas or input recorded.   Staff files identified that formal supervision meetings had not always taken place regularly. These meant  systems were not in place to monitor staff development and make sure that staff was able to meet people's  needs safely as discussed in effective. The provider did not have appropriate systems in place to record staff  training. For example, training certificates were stored within individual staff files and the matrix to monitor  the number of staff that had completed all the necessary was out of date at the time of inspection. It was  therefore not clear how the provider made sure staff were up to date with their skills and knowledge.   The provider had failed to act on important information such as incidents that had not been recorded,  safeguarding allegations that were not reported and other safety issues such as the recording of medicine  errors had not been completed. The lack of transparency and openness to listen to, act upon and report  issues or concerns raised meant we were concerned that the provider could not evaluate information, learn  from experiences and use this information to improve the quality and safety of care for people using the  service.  All the issues above meant there was a lack of systems in place to check that people's needs were being  met, records were inaccurate, out of date and there were no robust monitoring systems in place. We did not  see how the provider listened to people or staff and how their views were acted upon to make  improvements. The provider had failed to identify the shortfalls we found during this inspection and had not addressed the concerns we found at the previous inspection.  The issues above relate to a continued breach of Regulation 17 Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. Good Governance.  At our previous inspection in March 2017 we found the CQC had not received statutory notifications required to provide by law from the provider. During this inspection, we became aware of five incidents that had  occurred that had resulted in the local authority safeguarding team being contacted. The CQC had not  received notifications informing us of these safeguarding concerns. When we spoke to the registered  manager they told us that these incidents had been before the last inspection and they had not completed  notifications to us retrospectively. We knew of one incident that had occurred after our last inspection in  June 2017 where the police had been called. We had not received a statutory notification from the service   22 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  and we could not find evidence that the incident had been recorded at the service during our inspection.  The registered manager explained they had not completed an incident report or a statutory notification to  the CQC as this had happened away from the service and they did not think they needed to.   These issues above relate to a continued breach Regulation 18 Registration Regulations 2009. Notifications  of other incidents.  During our previous inspection and at this inspection we were concerned that the registered manager may  not have the skills, knowledge or qualifications to demonstrate the competency required to manage the  regulated activity. For example, when we asked how the registered manager was going to meet the  regulation for safe care and treatment at their last inspection they wrote in their action plan, ""This regulation was met and am not sure which area we did not meet the regulation."" This was concerning because it was  clear from our report how the service was not meeting its regulations and indicated the registered manager  had a poor understanding of their responsibilities under the Health and Social Care Act 2008. We asked to  see evidence of the registered manager's qualifications because we were concerned they may not have kept  up to date with their training and skills. We received evidence of a Level 4 NVQ in registered manager (Adult)  issued 4 August 2006, a certificate from Carshalton college for achieving a certificate in management studies  for care service managers, undated. A certificate in hoist instruction refresher course awarded July 2017 and  a ""high speed training certificate"" for safeguarding vulnerable adults completed after our inspection on 11  October 2017. We were also sent evidence of a membership with the chartered management institute. When we asked if any continuing professional development was required to maintain its membership we were  told, ""I attend courses of interest relevant to my business"". We were concerned that the registered manager  had not kept her skills and training up to date and this reflected on the day to day running of the service and  ultimately impacted on people's care.  The responses we received from the registered manager throughout our inspection, the written responses in the form of the action plan for our last inspection and the lack of up to date training did not provide us with  assurance that they had the necessary up to date qualifications, competence and skills to manage the  regulated activity.   This was a beach under Regulation 7 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Requirements relating to registered managers.  We asked where the service displayed its CQC rating of performance. The service does not have a website so  we looked around the communal areas but could not see a rating displayed at the service. We were shown  an easy read report that was attached to a notice board and told this had been shown to people who used  the service and discussed at resident meetings. It is a requirement to display the performance assessment.  This was a breach of Regulation 20A of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)  Regulations 2014. Requirements as to display of performance assessments.  During our inspection we referred to the Statement of Purpose for Carlton House. A statement of purpose for a business describes what you do, where you do it and who you do it to. The law requires this to be kept  under review and updated when required. When this document was last sent to us we found it was  inaccurate and out of date quoting old legislation and guidance, the provider later updated the document  and returned this to us. However, we found there were still areas within the statement of purpose that were  incomplete. For example, the statement of purpose makes it clear the service cares for people with learning  disabilities however during our inspection we saw people living at Carlton House had a wide range of needs  including mental health, autism, learning disability, end of life, older adults and those with other complex   23 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  healthcare needs. We were unsure from the statement of purpose how the service intended to cater for such a diversity of needs, while giving person centred care.  24 Carlton House Inspection report 13 December 2017  "

It is situated in the village of Broughton, close to local amenities.  Accommodation is provided over two floors, in single bedrooms with en suite facilities. There is a large  sitting room set out into two separate areas, a small sitting area and a dining/activities area. Two further  lounges are situated on the ground floor. Enclosed gardens to the side and rear of the building are easily  accessible. There is also a supported living house called Redbourne House. We undertook this inspection on 17 and 18 August 2017. The last inspection was carried out on 29 and 30 March and 3 April 2017 where the  service was found to be non-compliant with the regulations 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the  Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) as well as regulation 18 of the registration regulations. Due to concerns found during the inspection, the overall rating for the service was 'Inadequate' and the  service was therefore in 'special measures'.   Services in special measures will be kept under review and, if we have not taken immediate action to  propose to cancel the provider's registration of the service, will be inspected again within six months. The  expectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant  improvements within this timeframe.  If not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any  key question or overall, we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of  preventing the provider from operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve. This service will continue to be kept  under review and, if needed, could be escalated to urgent enforcement action. Where necessary, another  inspection will be conducted within a further six months, and if there is not enough improvement so there is  still a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall, we will take action to prevent the provider from  operating this service. This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their  registration.  For adult social care services, the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than  12 months. If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as  inadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures.  Following the inspection in March and April 2017, we met with the provider and have requested an interim  action plan. We also requested, and have received, weekly updates to assure us actions have been taken to  address the concerns.   After the focused inspection March and April 2017, the provider contracted the support of a management  company to help them make the required improvements and achieve compliance with the regulations. We  met with the consultant who represented the management company at this inspection. We refer to them as,  2 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  'the consultant' throughout this report.  During this inspection we found the provider's quality assurance systems continued to be ineffective. The  governance systems operated by the provider failed to cover all aspects of care delivery and did not identify  areas of the service that required improvement. The provider did not have oversight of the service as  required and was not consulted regarding people's care and support.  People who used the service did not always receive their medicines as prescribed. Instructions to staff about when medicines should be administered were not clear.   Staff had not always completed the necessary training to deliver the care and support the people who used  the service required.  People's care plans did not always contain suitable guidance to ensure staff could meet their needs  effectively and consistently.  The provider's recruitment practices were not robust. Some staff files did not contain relevant recruitment  information and thorough checks were not completed before agency staff worked with the people who used the service.  Elements of the environment did not meet people's needs; we found a window that did not have a restrictor, radiator covers were not in place and wooden garden furniture was water damaged with split and pliable  wood.  We found that people had restrictions in their lives that had not been agreed as in their best interests.   The registered manager did not have access to some people's care records and failed to ensure they have  oversight of their care. This meant there could be delays in any care or treatment they required.  We saw that improvements had been made with regards to some of the risks we identified at our previous  inspection, but found further evidence that the provider was not mitigating risks as required. For example,  legionella checks were not being carried out which put people who used the service at unnecessary risk. We  also found items of food, which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen in the freezer and  items that were past their used by or best before dates in fridges.  Staff, who received adequate support and mentorship were deployed in suitable numbers to meet people's  needs. Staff had completed safeguarding training and were aware of their responsibilities to report any  potential abuse and episodes of poor care they became aware of.  People were supported to eat a diet of their choosing and encouraged to make healthy choices.  People were treated with dignity and respect by staff; they were enabled to make choices in their daily lives.  We saw people taking part in different activities throughout the inspection.  The service had a registered manager who fulfilled their regulatory obligations to inform the Commission of  notifiable events that occurred with the service.  3 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  Inadequate    The five questions we ask about services and what we found  We always ask the following five questions of services.  	  The service was not always safe. People did not always receive  their medicines as prescribed.   Recruitment practices were not robust and the suitability of  agency staff was not adequately assessed.  Risks were not appropriately mitigated to ensure the health,  safety and welfare of the people who used the service.  Staff were deployed in suitable numbers to meet the needs of the people who used the service.  Staff had been trained to recognise the signs that could indicate  abuse had occurred and understood their responsibilities to  report any poor care they became aware of.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always effective. People who used the  service had restrictions placed upon them that had not been  agreed as in their best interests.   People were not always supported by staff who had the skills and abilities to meet their needs effectively.  Some parts of the service had not been adapted effectively to  meet people needs.  Staff received regular supervision and annual appraisals.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always caring. Some people's care records  were not stored appropriately and the registered manager did  not have access to them.   People's needs were met by attentive and caring staff.   People were treated with dignity and respect by staff. However,  we saw staff had used inappropriate language when describing  some care interventions.  4 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  People were supported to make choices in their daily lives.  	  Requires Improvement    The service was not always responsive. Although some people's  care plans had been updated since our last inspection, we found  that some contained generic information and lacked appropriate guidance for staff to follow.  The registered provider had a complaints policy and procedure  in place. The procedure was available in an easy read format to  make it more accessible to the people who used the service.   People who used the service were encouraged to take part in  activities of their choosing.  	  Inadequate    The service was not always well-led. The governance systems  and processes at the service were not effective.  The provider did not take responsibility for the day to day  management of the service.   There was a registered manager in place and the CQC received  notifications as required.  5 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017     Amber House  	  Background to this inspection We carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our  regulatory functions. This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal  requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall  quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.  The inspection took place on the 17 and 18 August 2017 and was unannounced. The inspection was  completed by three adult social care inspectors  Before this inspection, we reviewed the information we held about the service, such as notifications we had  received from the provider and their actions plans submitted to us following the last inspection.  Notifications are when providers send us information about certain changes, events or incidents that occur.  We spoke with the local authority commissioners and the local authority safeguarding team.  During the inspection we spoke with the registered manager, five members of care staff and two members of domestic staff. We also spoke with four people who used the service and three visiting healthcare  professionals. The consultant from the management company the provider had commissioned to support  with the required improvements at the service was also spoken with.  We looked at six people's care plans along with the associated risk assessments and Medication  Administration Records (MARs). We also looked at how the service used the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and  Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) to ensure that when people were assessed as lacking capacity to  make informed decisions themselves or when they were deprived of their liberty, actions were taken in their  best interest.  We also looked at a selection of documentation pertaining to the management and running of the service.  This included action plans, policies and procedures, business continuity plans, personal emergency  evacuation plans, recruitment information for staff, staff training records as well as audits and quality  monitoring information.  6 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   	  Inadequate  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (g) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care  and treatment. We found people's prescribed medicines including PRN (as required) medicines were not  recorded on their medicines administration records (MARs). We were unable to find information when the  medicines should be administered or when they had been given. We also found protocols did contain clear  instructions and suitable guidance to ensure they were administered safely and consistently.  During this inspection we saw one person had not received a medicine as prescribed. They had been  prescribed a medicine in patch form to be applied every 72 hours. However, staff had consistently applied  the patch every 96 hours. This had not been identified by any of the staff team during the timeframe of  records we checked, which was between 10 July and 17 August 2017. We have asked the registered manager to discuss this with the person's GP.  Staff had recorded they had given PRN medicines for pain, but not what the effect had been. Staff had  handwritten some MARs, however, full instructions about medicines had not been transcribed and a counter signature, to help prevent mistakes, had not always been made. Some medicines had been written by the  prescriber as 'as directed'; this did not give clear instruction to staff and we have asked the registered  manager to discuss this with the prescriber. Unclear directions posed a risk that errors may occur and  people may not receive the medicines they had been prescribed.  We saw protocols were in place for staff guidance when people who used the service were prescribed  medicines to be administered 'when required', referred to as PRN. The protocols did not give full  information to staff. For example, some people were prescribed a medicine to reduce anxieties up to two or  four times a day when required, however, there was no information about the interval required between the  doses. Other protocols referred to staff administering medicines when required when people 'displayed  signs of constipation', 'displayed signs of suffering' or 'for outward signs of agitation and anxiety'; there was  no information in the protocols about what these signs were for individual people. We also saw that some  people were prescribed medicines as a variable dose, for example one to two to be taken at night. There was no information to guide staff regarding the decision-making about which dose to administer.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  People who used the service told us they received their medicines on time. One person said, ""I always get it  on time, I have them at night too.""  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. We looked at  three staff recruitment files and found two had positive disclosure and barring service (DBS) checks. One of   7 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  these staff members had not declared the offences on their application form contrary to the provider's  recruitment policy which should preclude them from working at the service.  During this inspection we were told by the consultant that there had been a number of staff had left the  provider recently. They said, ""We have made a lot of change since the last inspection and some staff have  left which we view as a positive step. We have kept all of the ones we wanted to keep and lost the ones we  were happy to see go."" The registered manager added, ""The staff we have now are dedicated and very  compassionate.""   We asked how the provider ensured they deployed sufficient staff and were told that agency staff were being used as an interim measure. The consultant explained, ""We are currently using agency staff. The agency  provides all of the relevant information regarding staff that we need."" We reviewed the information held by the service in relation to agency staff and found that they could not  provide evidence that suitable checks had been undertaken. There was no evidence to support that  references had been gained by the agency or that gaps in people's employment history had been explored.   We assessed the recruitment of three permanent staff and found that interview questions and responses  were not always available.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, fit and proper persons employed. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (a) (b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe  care and treatment. We found the provider failed to appropriately assess and mitigate known risks in areas,  including, but not limited to, buildings works being carried out at the service, emergency evacuation plans  as well as fire and building safety.   During this inspection we found improvements had been made to the risks we had previously identified but  identified other risks that had not been appropriately mitigated.   Building works had been completed and no longer posed at risk to the people who used the service. We saw evidence that the local fire safety officer had visited and due to improvements made following our  inspection had no concerns regarding fire safety management at the service. We saw personal emergency  evacuation plans (PEEPs) had been updated for some people but not all. This meant they were at risk of not  receiving the support they required in an emergency situation.   We completed a tour of the premises and saw that work had been completed to improve the environment  but found that an upstairs window did not have a restrictor on it as required. This meant it could be could be opened fully, which put people who used the service at risk.  The service had no risk assessment regarding Legionnaires disease. Maintenance personnel told us the  service had hot and cold stored water in tanks, which posed a potential risk of legionella; they had not been  given any guidance regarding prevention of legionella. A cold water tank at the top of the basement steps  was in poor repair and leaking; a plumber was called out to attend to the leak on the day of inspection.  Maintenance personnel showed us water temperature checks they had completed; these were to ensure the hot water outlets were not above 43 degrees to prevent scalding. There was no evidence that unused  shower heads were descaled, disinfected and flushed. They confirmed the hot water tank was set at 60   8 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  degrees centigrade, which is required to help prevent legionella. Senior staff told us they would contact an  appropriate company and ensure a risk assessment was completed for the risk of Legionnaires disease.  We found items of fruit, salad and vegetables that were past their recommended 'use by' and 'best before'  dates. In freezers, we found items of food which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen. There were also packets of unopened vegetables that were not sealed. Items in the fridge such as processed meat  had labels, produced by catering staff, of when these had been opened and when they should be used by.  However, we found the labels did not match the 'use before date once opened' recommended by food  producers on the packet. These were mentioned to the registered manager to dispose of and address with  catering staff.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 (2) (a) (b) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008  (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. The action we have asked the provider to  take can be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 12 (2) (h) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safe care and treatment. We found concerns regarding infection prevention and control. We saw there was no dirty to  clean flow within the laundry room. Soiled washing was being stored in baskets on the floor alongside clean  laundry also stored in open baskets, creating the potential of cross contamination. Areas of the service  required a deep clean and staff failed to use personal protective equipment (PPE) when required.  During this inspection we found that the environment had been refurbished to a high standard and the  cleanliness of the service had greatly improved. Communal areas were clean and free from odours. Rooms  had been re-decorated and bathrooms and toilets had been re-fitted. We observed staff using PPE when  required and were told about the new laundry procedures in place. We noted appropriate storage of dirty  and clean clothes in the laundry. Mops and other cleaning products were stored appropriately and we saw  evidence that the domestic staff's weekly hours had increased by close to 50%. All of these factors helped to  ensure people were cared for in a clean and hygienic environment.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, safeguarding  service users from abuse and improper treatment. Staff had not always followed the provider's safeguarding policies in practice. For example, the deputy manager began an investigation rather than consulting with  the local safeguarding team to establish if this is what was required or whether the safeguarding team would complete their own investigation. We were told by staff and visiting professionals the training that staff  received on restrictive interventions, known as BASIS training, included details and a demonstration of  unapproved interventions that inflicted pain on the service users.   During this inspection we spoke with staff who had a clear understanding of the different types of abuse that may occur and the actions they would be required to take to keep people safe. Records showed staff had  completed safeguarding vulnerable adults training. A member of staff we spoke with said, ""I would report  abuse to my manager immediately. It's my duty.""  The consultant told us, ""We are aware of the local authorities safeguarding procedures and would report  abuse to them but we may need to complete part of an investigation to establish some facts so we could be  assured our service users were safe.""  We saw evidence that staff had completed an accredited three day training course to ensure any use of   9 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  physical interventions would be done safely. This helped to reduce the risk that people would be injured  during the delivery of essential care.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, staffing. We  found evidence that there had been several days when there was insufficient staff on duty to provide the  necessary care and support to people. This had impacted on the delivery of care for specific people who  used the service. When we spoke with the registered manager they told us they did not use a dependency  tool to calculate staffing levels for the service. They were unable to show us any systems they used to  establish the amount of staff, which should be on duty to ensure service users were supported on a one to  one basis, and other service users' needs were effectively met.  During this comprehensive inspection we saw that staff were deployed in appropriate numbers to meet the  needs of the people who used the service. We saw evidence that a dependency tool was being utilised to  ensure staffing levels were adequate. At the time of the inspection, there were eight people who lived in the  service and one person who stayed for respite care four days a week. Staff told us five people had one to one support from staff for 12 hours each day from 8am to 8pm and one person had this level of support between 9am and 5pm. A seventh person had one to one support for three hours a day, which could be used flexibly  when required. There were eight staff on duty during the day, which included a senior care support worker  and four staff at night. This level of staffing meant there was sufficient to meet the current numbers of  people who used the service and the level of needs they had. The registered manager was supernumerary to the rota and worked usual working hours during the week.  A member of staff commented, ""Things used to get a bit crazy, we would be running around and there never  seemed to be enough of us but things are different now. I think it really helps them [the people who used the service] when we have more time to spend with them.""   A visiting professional said, ""Now they don't have the day service here things are much better. When I've  visited I haven't had concerns about the number of staff.""  10 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-compliant with  Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, need for  consent. We found the application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA) was inconsistent. People had  restrictions in place around access to cigarettes and coffee at certain times. Another person who used the  service was having their mattress removed from their bedroom throughout the day. We were unable to find  any documentation within the service to show the decision to remove the mattress had been discussed and  recorded as in their best interest as the least restrictive option for them. We also found staff's knowledge in  relation to the MCA was limited.  During this inspection, we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was  required to ensure compliance with Regulation 11. The registered manager told us the restrictions around  people' coffee and cigarette intake continued and had been in place at a previous service. They stated that it was in the person's best interest but there was no evidence available to support this. The registered  manager explained, ""It is something that has always been in place and it does work really well but I will hold  my hands up we haven't had a best interest meeting about it."" The provider informed us that the person is  no longer living at the service so it no longer subjected to these restrictions.   Following the last inspection in March and April 2017 the registered manager told us that all staff would be  retrained in the MCA. However, at the time of this inspection no staff had completed refresher training in this area.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, need for consent. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found  at the end of this report.  We saw evidence to confirm that best interest meetings had taken place and decisions were in place for  other aspects in the service including the removal of a person's mattress. This had been agreed as the least  restrictive option and necessary to ensure the person, 'moved on' in the daily routines. A visiting  professional stated, ""I have been involved in supporting the service so that appropriate and least restrictive  care plans have been developed following best interest meetings.""  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and  equipment. We found concerns regarding the maintenance of the building. A meter cupboard door was  falling off its hinges when unlocked. An unlocked cupboard was found to contain loose screws, a knife, an  opened paint can and other debris. The unlocked cupboard had visible wires hanging and a light fitting  without a bulb, connected to the electric supply. We had issues with the lack of appropriate signage in the  kitchen accessed by people who used the service. Radiators did not have covers in place as required. When  we requested a copy of the most recent electrical wiring certificate we found this was dated 1 December  2012 and valid for one year. When we brought this to the attention of the registered manager they told us   11 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  they would arrange to have this checked as a matter of urgency.  During this inspection we saw that the majority of issues identified at our previous inspection had been  addressed but further work was needed before compliance was achieved. We saw evidence that an  electrical wiring testing was complete in May 2017. Signage was in place, cupboards in communal areas  were locked and access to them was restricted. However, there was only one radiator cover in place and this was at the entrance to the service. The registered manager explained, ""The provider is making the radiator  covers, all the radiators are different sizes so each was is bespoke. They are nearly finished and will be in  place very soon.""  We found there had been a roof leak in a store room where care files were held. These records had not been  affected, but two boxes [plastic stacking crates with lids] containing personal items belonging to a person  who used the service were wet and the contents at risk of damage. These were moved. There were other  issues such as wooden garden furniture, which was water damaged that had left the wood split and pliable.  There were two wheel chairs in need of cleaning. A team leader told us the garden furniture was to be  disposed of and the wheelchairs were rarely used, but they would see they were cleaned.  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and equipment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  During this inspection we saw records that confirmed staff had completed a range of training to equip them  will the skills and abilities to complete their roles. However, a number of agency staff were being used at the  service and their training records showed that had not completed any training in relation to supporting  people with autism. The consultant explained, ""We do recognise that as an issue, but there are no agencies  in the area that can supply us with staff who have that training."" They went on to say, ""We do closely monitor the staff so we are satisfied they are supporting people in a person centred way.""  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, staffing. The action we have asked the provider to take can be found at the end  of this report.  Records showed staff received appropriate levels of support and supervision. All staff had received a  supervision session since the last inspection. The supervision record had space to discuss the last  supervision and any concerns or actions that had arisen from it. Whether staff had any concerns and what  actions would be required to address them and any training or other recommendations.   People's health and social care needs were met by a range of healthcare professionals. Over the course of  the inspection a number of professionals visited the service. A visiting professional told us, ""I have worked  with Amber House for years. They have had issues in the past but I find they do everything they can for the  people who live here. I am always contacted if there is an issue and I feel that my advice is implemented and well received.""  People were supported to eat and balanced diet of their choosing. We saw the menus were written in  advance and reflected the choices a younger age group would make. The menus also included treats such  as a takeaway once a week. We observed the lunchtime experience and saw that people were supported  appropriately and were provided with adapted beakers, cutlery and plate guards to aid their independence.  12 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   We saw care records and other personal or confidential information were stored securely. Staff told us they  understood the importance of maintaining confidentiality. Access to computerised records was restricted to ensure private and sensitive information could only be accessed by appropriate staff. The registered  manager explained, ""We [the management and administrative] staff have our own passwords and different  levels of access. I can see things that other staff can't, it depends what they need to know for their job.""   We asked to see records from the part of the service where supported living care was delivered. The  registered manager told us they did not have access to these records. They said, ""The senior staff that work  there complete all of the paper work. I don't really check it."" The consultant explained, ""The records are held on a local compute which is not linked to Amber House."" This meant that the care and support of some  people who used the service was not overseen by the registered manager as required. Not having access to  the information could lead to delays in specific care and support being delayed. Following the inspection we were informed that the supported living part of the service would close to enable required improvements to  continue at Amber House.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and  equipment. While undertaking a tour of the building we observed a person who used the service naked,  compromising their dignity by undressing in public. Staff had difficulty assisting and encouraging them to  dress in order to maintain their dignity. We also heard staff asking a person if they needed to use the toilet in  front of their peers.   During this comprehensive inspection we found the provider had ensured necessary improvements had  been made and compliance with this regulation had been achieved. On a tour of the service we saw that  towels were placed in strategic areas of the service so that if a person did remove their clothing staff could  protect their modesty. Care plans had been developed to ensure staff knew how to support people in these  circumstances.   Throughout the inspection we saw staff treating people in a dignified and respectful way. We did hear a  member of staff speaking to a person in a way that did not appear age appropriate. However, when we  checked their care plan we saw that this was a known strategy to reduce the person's anxiety. A visiting  professional we spoke with confirmed this to be accurate.   We did however, see that a member of staff had recorded in the accident book that they had, 'reprimanded'  a person who used the service following an incident of behaviour that challenged the service. We  highlighted this to the registered manager to address.  We saw staff interacted well with people who used the service showing patience and demonstrating  knowledge of their preferences. One of the people who used the service described the staff as, ""Wonderful.""  Another person said, ""I can do what I want, the staff are nice to me.""  13 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  People who used the service told us that they were encouraged to make decisions and choices in their daily  lives. One person said, ""I choose what clothes [to wear]"" and ""They make lovely meals, I have a choice.""  Another person said they had a nice room and had a DVD player so they could watch DVDs in their room.  We saw evidence that people were given information and explanations in an appropriate format, which  promoted their understanding. Storyboards were used to support people's understanding of specific  activities such as appointments with healthcare professionals, visits from family or events. A storyboard uses pictorial symbols or photographs with numbers, times and dates to enable people to understand what will  occur and when. We also saw easy read versions of 'consent and capacity', 'MCA and DoLS' and 'No Secrets'  documents in people's care files.  We saw that advocacy information was stored in people's care files and that an advocacy group meeting  had taken place. The meeting was used to enable an independent mental capacity advocate (IMCA) to meet  the people who used the service and start to develop relationships so people understood what support was  available to them.  14 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Requires Improvement  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, person centred  care. We found the quality of the instructions provided to staff to keep people safe was varied and brief. For  example, one person's care plan said, 'use distraction techniques' but included no description of what these distraction techniques should be or for how long these should be used. Other care plans described 'habitual  behaviours', but did not detail what these were or how staff could recognise them and stated 'provide me  with my preferred method of  communication', but did not describe or offer guidance as to what this was.   During this inspection, we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was  required to ensure compliance with regulation 9. The consultant told us, ""We have had support from the  behavioural support team but all of the care plans are live documents and a work in progress. They will be  updated as people's needs changes or as the strategies we have put in place reduce some of their anxieties  and known behaviours.""  We saw that some people's care plans included detailed and personalised guidance that enabled staff to  understand the support people required when they were showing signs of agitation. However, we found  other care plans still contained generic guidance. For example, one person's behavioural management plan  stated staff should, 'use low arousal approach and distraction techniques' and that a precursor to  behaviours that challenged the service and others was indicated when, 'facial expressions change'. Failing  to provide accurate and detailed guidance to staff means people's needs would not be met consistently and effectively.  Descriptions of when physical interventions were to be used were generic and open to interpretation. One  person's behaviour management plan stated, 'the approved techniques must be proportionate to the  behaviour and applied for the minimum time necessary'. The descriptions of the support people required  were open to interpretation and lacked clear guidance.  We were told and saw evidence that care plans for people who lived at the service on a permanent basis had been updated. However, the care plans for people who used the service on a respite basis still required re- writing. This meant there was a risk that staff did not have the guidance they required to deliver care in line  with people's needs and preferences.   This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, premises and equipment. The action we have asked the provider to take can be  found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 16 (1) (2) of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, receiving and acting on complaints. We spoke to relatives and relevant professionals who told us they had raised a  number of formal complaints to the registered manager. These were in relation to the continuity of staff,   15 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  staffing levels, the impact of day care service and subjective recording in daily records and not following  care plans. However, the registered manager told us there had been no complaints since 2015.  During this inspection the consultant told us that improvements had been made with regards to the  complaints management within the service. They said, ""We have introduced a 'meet the manager day'. All  stakeholders, service users, relatives and professionals can meet the manager and discuss any issues or  thoughts they have. It is just one way to show they are accessible and open to feedback.""  The provider's complaints policy was displayed in the entrance to the service. It had been produced in an  easy read format that helped to ensure it was accessible to the people who used the service. Complaints  information was also available in people's care plans  A visiting relative we spoke with said, ""I have had discussions with the manager in the past and because she  acted on them I didn't feel the need to raise anything formally. I think the manager is receptive to feedback  and takes things on board."" A person who used the service said they had no complaints regarding the  service they received. They said, ""None at all; no reasons to.""  During the inspection we saw people taking part in activities of their choosing. One person told us they  enjoyed painting and arts and crafts. Another person said they liked to go shopping and swimming. A third  person said, ""I go to the shops to buy CDs, DVDs and books.""  16 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017   "	  Inadequate  	"   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulations 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014. This meant there was also a breach of Regulation 8 General.   During this inspection we found that some improvements had been made across the service, but further  work was required before the service achieved compliance against regulations 9, 11, 12, 15, 17, 18 and 19.   At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014, good  governance. There was no structured quality monitoring system in place that ensured identified shortfalls  were addressed in a timely way.   During this inspection we saw that internal quality monitoring systems had not improved. The consultant  told us they were fully aware of the provider's shortfalls in governance and would develop appropriate  systems. They said, ""The governance arrangements across the organisation are being further developed to  reduce the sometimes disjointed approach and to enhance the collation, interpretation and analysis of  information and subsequent action.""   The service did not have established and effective systems to assess monitor and improve the quality and  safety of care or to assess and mitigate risks. Accident and incident audits were not taking place, the  registered manager told us, ""I do look at all of the incidents but I don't audit them."" Failing to review  incidents and identify patterns and trends could lead to preventable incidents taking place within the  service.   Care plan audits were not being undertaken. We saw that monthly care plan assessments were completed  but these were not reviewed in conjunction with accident and incident records to establish in the guidance  provided to staff remained appropriate. They also failed to highlight that people were subject to restrictions  in their daily lives that had not been agreed, as in their best interests.  The provider had not undertaken audits of staff recruitment even though issues were highlighted at the last  inspection. The provider had also failed to audit the documentation provided by the recruitment company  who supplied agency staff. This meant they had not assured themselves of the agency staff's suitability and  fitness to work with vulnerable people.    We saw that some medication audits had been completed on a monthly basis, but these had not been  effective in highlighting that a person was not receiving their medicines as prescribed. The in effective audits being carried out lead to a person who had had been prescribed a particular medication to be taken every  72 hours receiving their medicines every 96 hours. The shortfalls in auditing could have led to the person  experiencing un-necessary pain.   17 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  Medication audits had also not identified that some medicines had been written by the prescriber 'as  directed'; which meant staff did not have adequate guidance to ensure staff knew have to administer  medicines safely and consistently.   Water temperature checks were carried out by maintenance staff but there was no evidence to show that  legionella checks were completed as required. This meant risks to the health, safety and welfare of the  people who used the service were not being assessed or mitigated.   We asked the registered manager to provide audits or the care and support provided in the supported living  service. The registered manager told us that they did not have managerial oversight and was not conducting quality assurance checks, they said, ""We have a senior member of staff there but I have to hold my hands up, I don't monitor it."" Following the inspection the consultant informed us that the provider intended to de- register the supported living service. This would be done following a notice period being served to the  people who used that part of the service.  There were no systems and processes to ensure the safe storage and disposal of food items. We identified  concerns with out of date, past the used by date and non-freeze food items. When we highlighted our  concerns immediate action was taken but the provider had no systems to identify issues with food storage  and safety.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 and the subsequent report we highlighted  concerns that radiators did not have covers and posed a risk to the people who used the service. Despite  this, during this inspection we found only one radiator cover was in place. This showed that provider did not  have effective systems in place to mitigate known risks.   The consultant told us, ""We are completely in a limbo situation, we have actions plans so know the areas  that we need to improve. We aren't auditing the work we have just completed because we know it's been  done to a high standard and we are not auditing the other areas because we know that needs to be  updated. Any audits we did now would just prevent us fixing us things.""  This demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated  Activities) Regulations 2014, need for good governance. The action we have asked the provider to take can  be found at the end of this report.  At our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017, we found the service to be non-complaint with  Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (registration) Regulations 2009, notification of other  incidents. The registered manager failed to notify the Commission of two incidents where people had  injured themselves and required hospital treatment.   During this inspection we reviewed the accident and incident records held at the service against the  information we had received from the provider. We found that we had been informed of all notifiable events  as required. The registered manager commented, ""The incidents that didn't get reported were a mistake. I  know what needs to be reported. We try to be open and transparent about everything that happens.""  The registered manager told us they had not been supported in their role to ensure positive outcomes for  people. They said, ""The directors are very supportive in some areas, but they don't have a background in  care so when it came down to the residents I was left to get on with things myself. I have had more support  from [name of the consultant] in the short time they have been here than I ever have before."" The consultant told us, ""We know there are a lot of improvements to make. I initially came on board for nine weeks and that   18 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  has already been extended to 12 months. I am committed to turning things around and making this a good  service for all of our residents.""  19 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017  This section is primarily information for the provider  Action we have told the provider to take  The table below shows where regulations were not being met and we have asked the provider to send us a  report that says what action they are going to take.We will check that this action is taken by the provider.
