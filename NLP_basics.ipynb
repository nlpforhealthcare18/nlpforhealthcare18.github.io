      "requirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008, to look at the overall \n",
      "quality of the service, and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "This unannounced inspection took place on 26 January 2017. The inspection team consisted of one \n",
      "inspector and an expert by experience.  An expert by experience is a person who has personal experience of \n",
      "using or caring for someone who uses this type of service.\n",
      "\n",
      "We asked the provider to complete a Provider Information Return (PIR). This is a form that asks the provider \n",
      "to give some key information about the service, what the service does well and improvements they plan to \n",
      "make. The PIR was returned within the required timescale.  As part of the inspection process we also looked \n",
      "at information we already had about the provider. Providers are required to notify the Care Quality \n",
      "Commission about specific events and incidents that occur including serious injuries to people receiving \n",
      "care and any incidences which put people at risk of harm. We refer to these as notifications. We reviewed the\n",
      "notifications that the provider had sent us, to plan the areas we wanted to focus on during our inspection.  \n",
      "We reviewed regular quality reports sent to us by the local authority to see what information they held about\n",
      "the service. These are reports that tell us if the local authority has concerns about the service they purchase \n",
      "on behalf of people.    \n",

Commission CQC to provide accommodation and \\npersonal care for a maximum of 13 people It is situated in the village of Broughton close to local amenities\\n\\nAccommodation is provided over two floors in single bedrooms with en suite facilities There is a large \\nsitting room set out into two separate areas a small sitting area and a diningactivities area Two further \\nlounges are situated on the ground floor Enclosed gardens to the side and rear of the building are easily \\naccessible There is also a supported living house called Redbourne House We undertook this inspection on\\n17 and 18 August 2017 The last inspection was carried out on 29 and 30 March and 3 April 2017 where the \\nservice was found to be noncompliant with the regulations 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 18 and 19 of the \\nHealth and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities as well as regulation 18 of the registration regulations\\nDue to concerns found during the inspection the overall rating for the service was Inadequate and the \\nservice was therefore in special measures \\n\\nServices in special measures will be kept under review and if we have not taken immediate action to \\npropose to cancel the providers registration of the service will be inspected again within six months The \\nexpectation is that providers found to have been providing inadequate care should have made significant \\nimprovements within this timeframe\\n\\nIf not enough improvement is made within this timeframe so that there is still a rating of inadequate for any \\nkey question or overall we will take action in line with our enforcement procedures to begin the process of \\npreventing the provider from operating this service This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying\\nthe terms of their registration within six months if they do not improve This service will continue to be kept \\nunder review and if needed could be escalated to urgent enforcement action Where necessary another \\ninspection will be conducted within a further six months and if there is not enough improvement so there is \\nstill a rating of inadequate for any key question or overall we will take action to prevent the provider from \\noperating this service This will lead to cancelling their registration or to varying the terms of their \\nregistration\\n\\nFor adult social care services the maximum time for being in special measures will usually be no more than \\n12 months If the service has demonstrated improvements when we inspect it and it is no longer rated as \\ninadequate for any of the five key questions it will no longer be in special measures\\n\\nFollowing the inspection in March and April 2017 we met with the provider and have requested an interim \\naction plan We also requested and have received weekly updates to assure us actions have been taken to \\naddress the concerns \\n\\nAfter the focused inspection March and April 2017 the provider contracted the support of a management \\ncompany to help them make the required improvements and achieve compliance with the regulations We \\nmet with the consultant who represented the management company at this inspection We refer to them as\\n\\n2 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cthe consultant throughout this report\\n\\nDuring this inspection we found the providers quality assurance systems continued to be ineffective The \\ngovernance systems operated by the provider failed to cover all aspects of care delivery and did not identify \\nareas of the service that required improvement The provider did not have oversight of the service as \\nrequired and was not consulted regarding peoples care and support\\n\\nPeople who used the service did not always receive their medicines as prescribed Instructions to staff about\\nwhen medicines should be administered were not clear \\n\\nStaff had not always completed the necessary training to deliver the care and support the people who used \\nthe service required\\n\\nPeoples care plans did not always contain suitable guidance to ensure staff could meet their needs \\neffectively and consistently\\n\\nThe providers recruitment practices were not robust Some staff files did not contain relevant recruitment \\ninformation and thorough checks were not completed before agency staff worked with the people who used\\nthe service\\n\\nElements of the environment did not meet peoples needs we found a window that did not have a restrictor\\nradiator covers were not in place and wooden garden furniture was water damaged with split and pliable \\nwood\\n\\nWe found that people had restrictions in their lives that had not been agreed as in their best interests \\n\\nThe registered manager did not have access to some peoples care records and failed to ensure they have \\noversight of their care This meant there could be delays in any care or treatment they required\\n\\nWe saw that improvements had been made with regards to some of the risks we identified at our previous \\ninspection but found further evidence that the provider was not mitigating risks as required For example \\nlegionella checks were not being carried out which put people who used the service at unnecessary risk We \\nalso found items of food which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen in the freezer and \\nitems that were past their used by or best before dates in fridges\\n\\nStaff who received adequate support and mentorship were deployed in suitable numbers to meet peoples \\nneeds Staff had completed safeguarding training and were aware of their responsibilities to report any \\npotential abuse and episodes of poor care they became aware of\\n\\nPeople were supported to eat a diet of their choosing and encouraged to make healthy choices\\n\\nPeople were treated with dignity and respect by staff they were enabled to make choices in their daily lives \\nWe saw people taking part in different activities throughout the inspection\\n\\nThe service had a registered manager who fulfilled their regulatory obligations to inform the Commission of \\nnotifiable events that occurred with the service\\n\\n3 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cInadequate  \\n\\nThe five questions we ask about services and what we found\\n\\nWe always ask the following five questions

care interventions\\n\\n4 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cPeople were supported to make choices in their daily lives\\n\\nIs the service responsive\\n\\nRequires Improvement  \\n\\nThe service was not always responsive Although some peoples \\ncare plans had been updated since our last inspection we found \\nthat some contained generic information and lacked

accessible to the people who used the service \\n\\nPeople who used the service were encouraged to take part in \\nactivities of their choosing\\n\\nIs the service wellled\\n\\nInadequate  \\n\\nThe

\\n\\nThere was a registered manager in place and the CQC received \\nnotifications as required\\n\\n5 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0c \\n\\nAmber House\\n\\nDetailed findings\\n\\nBackground to this inspection\\nWe carried out this inspection under Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 as part of our \\nregulatory functions This inspection was planned to check whether the provider is meeting the legal \\nrequirements and regulations associated with the Health and Social Care Act 2008 to look at the overall \\nquality of the service and to provide a rating for the service under the Care Act 2014\\n\\nThe inspection took place on the 17 and 18 August 2017 and was unannounced The inspection was \\ncompleted by three adult social care inspectors\\n\\nBefore this inspection we reviewed the information we held about the service such as notifications we had \\nreceived from the provider and their actions plans submitted to us following the last inspection \\nNotifications are when providers send us information about certain changes events or incidents that occur \\nWe spoke with the local authority commissioners and the local authority safeguarding team\\n\\nDuring the inspection we spoke with the registered manager five members of care staff and two members of\\ndomestic staff We also spoke with four people who used the service and three visiting healthcare \\nprofessionals The consultant from the management company the provider had commissioned to support \\nwith the required improvements at the service was also spoken with\\n\\nWe looked at six peoples care plans along with the associated risk assessments and Medication \\nAdministration Records MARs We also looked at how the service used the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and \\nDeprivation of Liberty Safeguards DoLS to ensure that when people were assessed as lacking capacity to \\nmake informed decisions themselves or when they were deprived of their liberty actions were taken in their \\nbest interest\\n\\nWe also looked at a selection of documentation pertaining to the management and running of the service \\nThis included action plans policies and procedures business continuity plans personal emergency \\nevacuation plans recruitment information for staff staff training records as well as audits and quality \\nmonitoring information\\n\\n6 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0c Is the service safe\\n\\nInadequate\\n\\nOur findings  \\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 12 2 g of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 safe care \\nand treatment We found peoples prescribed medicines including PRN as required medicines were not \\nrecorded on their medicines administration records MARs We were unable to find information when the \\nmedicines should be administered or when they had been given We also found protocols did contain clear \\ninstructions and suitable guidance to ensure they were administered safely and consistently\\n\\nDuring this inspection we saw one person had not received a medicine as prescribed They had been \\nprescribed a medicine in patch form to be applied every 72 hours However staff had consistently applied \\nthe patch every 96 hours This had not been identified by any of the staff team during the timeframe of \\nrecords we checked which was between 10 July and 17 August 2017 We have asked the registered manager\\nto discuss this with the persons GP\\n\\nStaff had recorded they had given PRN medicines for pain but not what the effect had been Staff had \\nhandwritten some MARs however full instructions about medicines had not been transcribed and a counter\\nsignature to help prevent mistakes had not always been made Some medicines had been written by the \\nprescriber as as directed this did not give clear instruction to staff and we have asked the registered \\nmanager to discuss this with the prescriber Unclear directions posed a risk that errors may occur and \\npeople may not receive the medicines they had been prescribed\\n\\nWe saw protocols were in place for staff guidance when people who used the service were prescribed \\nmedicines to be administered when required referred to as PRN The protocols did not give full \\ninformation to staff For example some people were prescribed a medicine to reduce anxieties up to two or \\nfour times a day when required however there was no information about the interval required between the \\ndoses Other protocols referred to staff administering medicines when required when people displayed \\nsigns of constipation displayed signs of suffering or for outward signs of agitation and anxiety there was \\nno information in the protocols about what these signs were for individual people We also saw that some \\npeople were prescribed medicines as a variable dose for example one to two to be taken at night There was\\nno information to guide staff regarding the decisionmaking about which dose to administer \\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 safe care and treatment The action we have asked the provider to take can be \\nfound at the end of this report\\n\\nPeople who used the service told us they received their medicines on time One person said I always get it \\non time I have them at night too\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 We looked at \\nthree staff recruitment files and found two had positive disclosure and barring service DBS checks One of \\n\\n7 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cthese staff members had not declared the offences on their application form contrary to the providers \\nrecruitment policy which should preclude them from working at the service\\n\\nDuring this inspection we were told by the consultant that there had been a number of staff had left the \\nprovider recently They said We have made a lot of change since the last inspection and some staff have \\nleft which we view as a positive step We have kept all of the ones we wanted to keep and lost the ones we \\nwere happy to see go The registered manager added The staff we have now are dedicated and very \\ncompassionate \\n\\nWe asked how the provider ensured they deployed sufficient staff and were told that agency staff were being\\nused as an interim measure The consultant explained We are currently using agency staff The agency \\nprovides all of the relevant information regarding staff that we need\\nWe reviewed the information held by the service in relation to agency staff and found that they could not \\nprovide evidence that suitable checks had been undertaken There was no evidence to support that \\nreferences had been gained by the agency or that gaps in peoples employment history had been explored \\n\\nWe assessed the recruitment of three permanent staff and found that interview questions and responses \\nwere not always available \\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 fit and proper persons employed The action we have asked the provider to take\\ncan be found at the end of this report\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 12 2 a b of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 safe \\ncare and treatment We found the provider failed to appropriately assess and mitigate known risks in areas \\nincluding but not limited to buildings works being carried out at the service emergency evacuation plans \\nas well as fire and building safety \\n\\nDuring this inspection we found improvements had been made to the risks we had previously identified but \\nidentified other risks that had not been appropriately mitigated \\n\\nBuilding works had been completed and no longer posed at risk to the people who used the service We saw\\nevidence that the local fire safety officer had visited and due to improvements made following our \\ninspection had no concerns regarding fire safety management at the service We saw personal emergency \\nevacuation plans PEEPs had been updated for some people but not all This meant they were at risk of not \\nreceiving the support they required in an emergency situation \\n\\nWe completed a tour of the premises and saw that work had been completed to improve the environment \\nbut found that an upstairs window did not have a restrictor on it as required This meant it could be could be\\nopened fully which put people who used the service at risk\\n\\nThe service had no risk assessment regarding Legionnaires disease Maintenance personnel told us the \\nservice had hot and cold stored water in tanks which posed a potential risk of legionella they had not been \\ngiven any guidance regarding prevention of legionella A cold water tank at the top of the basement steps \\nwas in poor repair and leaking a plumber was called out to attend to the leak on the day of inspection \\nMaintenance personnel showed us water temperature checks they had completed these were to ensure the\\nhot water outlets were not above 43 degrees to prevent scalding There was no evidence that unused \\nshower heads were descaled disinfected and flushed They confirmed the hot water tank was set at 60 \\n\\n8 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cdegrees centigrade which is required to help prevent legionella Senior staff told us they would contact an \\nappropriate company and ensure a risk assessment was completed for the risk of Legionnaires disease\\n\\nWe found items of fruit salad and vegetables that were past their recommended use by and best before \\ndates In freezers we found items of food which indicated on the packet that they could not be frozen There\\nwere also packets of unopened vegetables that were not sealed Items in the fridge such as processed meat \\nhad labels produced by catering staff of when these had been opened and when they should be used by \\nHowever we found the labels did not match the use before date once opened recommended by food \\nproducers on the packet These were mentioned to the registered manager to dispose of and address with \\ncatering staff\\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 12 2 a b of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 \\nRegulated Activities Regulations 2014 safe care and treatment The action we have asked the provider to \\ntake can be found at the end of this report\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 12 2 h of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 safe care\\nand treatment We found concerns regarding infection prevention and control We saw there was no dirty to \\nclean flow within the laundry room Soiled washing was being stored in baskets on the floor alongside clean \\nlaundry also stored in open baskets creating the potential of cross contamination Areas of the service \\nrequired a deep clean and staff failed to use personal protective equipment PPE when required\\n\\nDuring this inspection we found that the environment had been refurbished to a high standard and the \\ncleanliness of the service had greatly improved Communal areas were clean and free from odours Rooms \\nhad been redecorated and bathrooms and toilets had been refitted We observed staff using PPE when \\nrequired and were told about the new laundry procedures in place We noted appropriate storage of dirty \\nand clean clothes in the laundry Mops and other cleaning products were stored appropriately and we saw \\nevidence that the domestic staffs weekly hours had increased by close to 50 All of these factors helped to \\nensure people were cared for in a clean and hygienic environment\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 safeguarding \\nservice users from abuse and improper treatment Staff had not always followed the providers safeguarding\\npolicies in practice For example the deputy manager began an investigation rather than consulting with \\nthe local safeguarding team to establish if this is what was required or whether the safeguarding team would\\ncomplete their own investigation We were told by staff and visiting professionals the training that staff \\nreceived on restrictive interventions known as BASIS training included details and a demonstration of \\nunapproved interventions that inflicted pain on the service users \\n\\nDuring this inspection we spoke with staff who had a clear understanding of the different types of abuse that\\nmay occur and the actions they would be required to take to keep people safe Records showed staff had \\ncompleted safeguarding vulnerable adults training A member of staff we spoke with said I would report \\nabuse to my manager immediately Its my duty\\n\\nThe consultant told us We are aware of the local authorities safeguarding procedures and would report \\nabuse to them but we may need to complete part of an investigation to establish some facts so we could be \\nassured our service users were safe\\n\\nWe saw evidence that staff had completed an accredited three day training course to ensure any use of \\n\\n9 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cphysical interventions would be done safely This helped to reduce the risk that people would be injured \\nduring the delivery of essential care\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 staffing We \\nfound evidence that there had been several days when there was insufficient staff on duty to provide the \\nnecessary care and support to people This had impacted on the delivery of care for specific people who \\nused the service When we spoke with the registered manager they told us they did not use a dependency \\ntool to calculate staffing levels for the service They were unable to show us any systems they used to \\nestablish the amount of staff which should be on duty to ensure service users were supported on a one to \\none basis and other service users needs were effectively met\\n\\nDuring this comprehensive inspection we saw that staff were deployed in appropriate numbers to meet the \\nneeds of the people who used the service We saw evidence that a dependency tool was being utilised to \\nensure staffing levels were adequate At the time of the inspection there were eight people who lived in the \\nservice and one person who stayed for respite care four days a week Staff told us five people had one to one\\nsupport from staff for 12 hours each day from 8am to 8pm and one person had this level of support between\\n9am and 5pm A seventh person had one to one support for three hours a day which could be used flexibly \\nwhen required There were eight staff on duty during the day which included a senior care support worker \\nand four staff at night This level of staffing meant there was sufficient to meet the current numbers of \\npeople who used the service and the level of needs they had The registered manager was supernumerary to\\nthe rota and worked usual working hours during the week\\n\\nA member of staff commented Things used to get a bit crazy we would be running around and there never \\nseemed to be enough of us but things are different now I think it really helps them the people who used the\\nservice when we have more time to spend with them \\n\\nA visiting professional said Now they dont have the day service here things are much better When Ive \\nvisited I havent had concerns about the number of staff\\n\\n10 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0c Is the service effective\\n\\nRequires Improvement\\n\\nOur findings  \\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncompliant with \\nRegulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 need for \\nconsent We found the application of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 MCA was inconsistent People had \\nrestrictions in place around access to cigarettes and coffee at certain times Another person who used the \\nservice was having their mattress removed from their bedroom throughout the day We were unable to find \\nany documentation within the service to show the decision to remove the mattress had been discussed and \\nrecorded as in their best interest as the least restrictive option for them We also found staffs knowledge in \\nrelation to the MCA was limited\\n\\nDuring this inspection we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was \\nrequired to ensure compliance with Regulation 11 The registered manager told us the restrictions around \\npeople coffee and cigarette intake continued and had been in place at a previous service They stated that it\\nwas in the persons best interest but there was no evidence available to support this The registered \\nmanager explained It is something that has always been in place and it does work really well but I will hold \\nmy hands up we havent had a best interest meeting about it The provider informed us that the person is \\nno longer living at the service so it no longer subjected to these restrictions \\n\\nFollowing the last inspection in March and April 2017 the registered manager told us that all staff would be \\nretrained in the MCA However at the time of this inspection no staff had completed refresher training in this\\narea\\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 need for consent The action we have asked the provider to take can be found \\nat the end of this report\\n\\nWe saw evidence to confirm that best interest meetings had taken place and decisions were in place for \\nother aspects in the service including the removal of a persons mattress This had been agreed as the least \\nrestrictive option and necessary to ensure the person moved on in the daily routines A visiting \\nprofessional stated I have been involved in supporting the service so that appropriate and least restrictive \\ncare plans have been developed following best interest meetings\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 premises and \\nequipment We found concerns regarding the maintenance of the building A meter cupboard door was \\nfalling off its hinges when unlocked An unlocked cupboard was found to contain loose screws a knife an \\nopened paint can and other debris The unlocked cupboard had visible wires hanging and a light fitting \\nwithout a bulb connected to the electric supply We had issues with the lack of appropriate signage in the \\nkitchen accessed by people who used the service Radiators did not have covers in place as required When \\nwe requested a copy of the most recent electrical wiring certificate we found this was dated 1 December \\n2012 and valid for one year When we brought this to the attention of the registered manager they told us \\n\\n11 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cthey would arrange to have this checked as a matter of urgency\\n\\nDuring this inspection we saw that the majority of issues identified at our previous inspection had been \\naddressed but further work was needed before compliance was achieved We saw evidence that an \\nelectrical wiring testing was complete in May 2017 Signage was in place cupboards in communal areas \\nwere locked and access to them was restricted However there was only one radiator cover in place and this\\nwas at the entrance to the service The registered manager explained The provider is making the radiator \\ncovers all the radiators are different sizes so each was is bespoke They are nearly finished and will be in \\nplace very soon\\n\\nWe found there had been a roof leak in a store room where care files were held These records had not been \\naffected but two boxes plastic stacking crates with lids containing personal items belonging to a person \\nwho used the service were wet and the contents at risk of damage These were moved There were other \\nissues such as wooden garden furniture which was water damaged that had left the wood split and pliable \\nThere were two wheel chairs in need of cleaning A team leader told us the garden furniture was to be \\ndisposed of and the wheelchairs were rarely used but they would see they were cleaned\\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 15 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 premises and equipment The action we have asked the provider to take can be \\nfound at the end of this report\\n\\nDuring this inspection we saw records that confirmed staff had completed a range of training to equip them \\nwill the skills and abilities to complete their roles However a number of agency staff were being used at the \\nservice and their training records showed that had not completed any training in relation to supporting \\npeople with autism The consultant explained We do recognise that as an issue but there are no agencies \\nin the area that can supply us with staff who have that training They went on to say We do closely monitor\\nthe staff so we are satisfied they are supporting people in a person centred way\\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 staffing The action we have asked the provider to take can be found at the end \\nof this report\\n\\nRecords showed staff received appropriate levels of support and supervision All staff had received a \\nsupervision session since the last inspection The supervision record had space to discuss the last \\nsupervision and any concerns or actions that had arisen from it Whether staff had any concerns and what \\nactions would be required to address them and any training or other recommendations \\n\\nPeoples health and social care needs were met by a range of healthcare professionals Over the course of \\nthe inspection a number of professionals visited the service A visiting professional told us I have worked \\nwith Amber House for years They have had issues in the past but I find they do everything they can for the \\npeople who live here I am always contacted if there is an issue and I feel that my advice is implemented and\\nwell received\\n\\nPeople were supported to eat and balanced diet of their choosing We saw the menus were written in \\nadvance and reflected the choices a younger age group would make The menus also included treats such \\nas a takeaway once a week We observed the lunchtime experience and saw that people were supported \\nappropriately and were provided with adapted beakers cutlery and plate guards to aid their independence\\n\\n12 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0c Is the service caring\\n\\nRequires Improvement\\n\\nOur findings  \\nWe saw care records and other personal or confidential information were stored securely Staff told us they \\nunderstood the importance of maintaining confidentiality Access to computerised records was restricted to\\nensure private and sensitive information could only be accessed by appropriate staff The registered \\nmanager explained We the management and administrative staff have our own passwords and different \\nlevels of access I can see things that other staff cant it depends what they need to know for their job \\n\\nWe asked to see records from the part of the service where supported living care was delivered The \\nregistered manager told us they did not have access to these records They said The senior staff that work \\nthere complete all of the paper work I dont really check it The consultant explained The records are held\\non a local compute which is not linked to Amber House This meant that the care and support of some \\npeople who used the service was not overseen by the registered manager as required Not having access to \\nthe information could lead to delays in specific care and support being delayed Following the inspection we\\nwere informed that the supported living part of the service would close to enable required improvements to \\ncontinue at Amber House\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 10 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 premises and \\nequipment While undertaking a tour of the building we observed a person who used the service naked \\ncompromising their dignity by undressing in public Staff had difficulty assisting and encouraging them to \\ndress in order to maintain their dignity We also heard staff asking a person if they needed to use the toilet in \\nfront of their peers \\n\\nDuring this comprehensive inspection we found the provider had ensured necessary improvements had \\nbeen made and compliance with this regulation had been achieved On a tour of the service we saw that \\ntowels were placed in strategic areas of the service so that if a person did remove their clothing staff could \\nprotect their modesty Care plans had been developed to ensure staff knew how to support people in these \\ncircumstances \\n\\nThroughout the inspection we saw staff treating people in a dignified and respectful way We did hear a \\nmember of staff speaking to a person in a way that did not appear age appropriate However when we \\nchecked their care plan we saw that this was a known strategy to reduce the persons anxiety A visiting \\nprofessional we spoke with confirmed this to be accurate \\n\\nWe did however see that a member of staff had recorded in the accident book that they had reprimanded \\na person who used the service following an incident of behaviour that challenged the service We \\nhighlighted this to the registered manager to address\\n\\nWe saw staff interacted well with people who used the service showing patience and demonstrating \\nknowledge of their preferences One of the people who used the service described the staff as Wonderful \\nAnother person said I can do what I want the staff are nice to me\\n\\n13 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cPeople who used the service told us that they were encouraged to make decisions and choices in their daily \\nlives One person said I choose what clothes to wear and They make lovely meals I have a choice \\nAnother person said they had a nice room and had a DVD player so they could

peoples understanding of specific \\nactivities such as appointments with healthcare professionals visits from family or events A storyboard uses\\npictorial symbols or photographs with numbers times and dates to enable people to understand what will \\noccur and when We also saw easy read versions of consent and capacity MCA and DoLS and No Secrets \\ndocuments in peoples care files\\n\\nWe saw that advocacy information was stored in peoples care files and that an advocacy group meeting \\nhad taken place The meeting was used to enable an independent mental capacity advocate IMCA to meet \\nthe people who used the service and start to develop relationships so people understood what support was \\navailable to them\\n\\n14 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0c Is the service responsive\\n\\nRequires Improvement\\n\\nOur findings  \\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 person centred \\ncare We found the quality of the instructions provided to staff to keep people safe was varied and brief For \\nexample one persons care plan said use distraction techniques but included no description of what these\\ndistraction techniques should be or for how long these should be used Other care plans described habitual \\nbehaviours but did not detail what these were or how staff could recognise them and stated provide me \\nwith my preferred method of  communication but did not describe or offer guidance as to what this was \\n\\nDuring this inspection we found that improvements had been made in this area but further work was \\nrequired to ensure compliance with regulation 9 The consultant told us We have had support from the \\nbehavioural support team but all of the care plans are live documents and a work in progress They will be \\nupdated as peoples needs changes or as the strategies we have put in place reduce some of their anxieties \\nand known behaviours\\n\\nWe saw that some peoples care plans included detailed and personalised guidance that enabled staff to \\nunderstand the support people required when they were showing signs of agitation However we found \\nother care plans still contained generic guidance For example one persons behavioural management plan \\nstated staff should use low arousal approach and distraction techniques and that a precursor to \\nbehaviours that challenged the service and others was indicated when facial expressions change Failing \\nto provide accurate and detailed guidance to staff means peoples needs would not be met consistently and\\neffectively\\n\\nDescriptions of when physical interventions were to be used were generic and open to interpretation One \\npersons behaviour management plan stated the approved techniques must be proportionate to the \\nbehaviour and applied for the minimum time necessary The descriptions of the support people required \\nwere open to interpretation and lacked clear guidance\\n\\nWe were told and saw evidence that care plans for people who lived at the service on a permanent basis had\\nbeen updated However the care plans for people who used the service on a respite basis still required re\\nwriting This meant there was a risk that staff did not have the guidance they required to deliver care in line \\nwith peoples needs and preferences \\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 9 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 premises and equipment The action we have asked the provider to take can be \\nfound at the end of this report\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 16 1 2 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 receiving\\nand acting on complaints We spoke to relatives and relevant professionals who told us they had raised a \\nnumber of formal complaints to the registered manager These were in relation to the continuity of staff \\n\\n15 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cstaffing levels the impact of day care service and subjective recording in daily records and not following \\ncare plans However the registered manager told us there had been no complaints since 2015\\n\\nDuring this inspection the consultant told us that improvements had been made with regards to the \\ncomplaints management within the service They said We have introduced a meet the manager day All \\nstakeholders service users relatives and professionals can meet the manager and discuss any issues or \\nthoughts they have It is just one way to show they are accessible and open to feedback\\n\\nThe providers complaints policy was displayed in the entrance to the service It had been produced in an \\neasy read format that helped to ensure it was accessible to the people who used the service Complaints \\ninformation was also available in peoples care plans\\n\\nA visiting relative we spoke with said I have had discussions with the manager in the past and because she \\nacted on them I didnt feel the need to raise anything formally I think the manager is receptive to feedback \\nand takes things on board A person who used the service said they had no complaints regarding the \\nservice they received They said None at all no reasons to\\n\\nDuring the inspection we saw people taking part in activities of

the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulations 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 17 18 and 19 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 This meant there was also a breach of Regulation 8 General \\n\\nDuring this inspection we found that some improvements had been made across the service but further \\nwork was required before the service achieved compliance against regulations 9 11 12 15 17 18 and 19 \\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated Activities Regulations 2014 good \\ngovernance There was no structured quality monitoring system in place that ensured identified shortfalls \\nwere addressed in a timely way \\n\\nDuring this inspection we saw that internal quality monitoring systems had not improved The consultant \\ntold us they were fully aware of the providers shortfalls in governance and would develop appropriate \\nsystems They said The governance arrangements across the organisation are being further developed to \\nreduce the sometimes disjointed approach and to enhance the collation interpretation and analysis of \\ninformation and subsequent action \\n\\nThe service did not have established and effective systems to assess monitor and improve the quality and \\nsafety of care or to assess and mitigate risks Accident and incident audits were not taking place the \\nregistered manager told us I do look at all of the incidents but I dont audit them Failing to review \\nincidents and identify patterns and trends could lead to preventable incidents taking place within the \\nservice \\n\\nCare plan audits were not being undertaken We saw that monthly care plan assessments were completed \\nbut these were not reviewed in conjunction with accident and incident records to establish in the guidance \\nprovided to staff remained appropriate They also failed to highlight that people were subject to restrictions \\nin their daily lives that had not been agreed as in their best interests\\n\\nThe provider had not undertaken audits of staff recruitment even though issues were highlighted at the last \\ninspection The provider had also failed to audit the documentation provided by the recruitment company \\nwho supplied agency staff This meant they had not assured themselves of the agency staffs suitability and \\nfitness to work with vulnerable people  \\n\\nWe saw that some medication audits had been completed on a monthly basis but these had not been \\neffective in highlighting that a person was not receiving their medicines as prescribed The in effective audits\\nbeing carried out lead to a person who had had been prescribed a particular medication to be taken every \\n72 hours receiving their medicines every 96 hours The shortfalls in auditing could have led to the person \\nexperiencing unnecessary pain \\n\\n17 Amber House Inspection report 14 November 2017\\n\\n\\x0cMedication audits had also not identified that some medicines had been written by the prescriber as \\ndirected which meant staff did not have adequate guidance to ensure staff knew have to administer \\nmedicines safely and consistently \\n\\nWater temperature checks were carried out by maintenance staff but there was no evidence to show that \\nlegionella checks were completed as required This meant risks to the health safety and welfare of the \\npeople who used the service were not being assessed or mitigated \\n\\nWe asked the registered manager to provide audits or the care and support provided in the supported living \\nservice The registered manager told us that they did not have managerial oversight and was not conducting\\nquality assurance checks they said We have a senior member of staff there but I have to hold my hands up\\nI dont monitor it Following the inspection the consultant informed us that the provider intended to de\\nregister the supported living service This would be done following a notice period being served to the \\npeople who used that part of the service\\n\\nThere were no systems and processes to ensure the safe storage and disposal of food items We identified \\nconcerns with out of date past the used by date and nonfreeze food items When we highlighted our \\nconcerns immediate action was taken but the provider had no systems to identify issues with food storage \\nand safety\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 and the subsequent report we highlighted \\nconcerns that radiators did not have covers and posed a risk to the people who used the service Despite \\nthis during this inspection we found only one radiator cover was in place This showed that provider did not \\nhave effective systems in place to mitigate known risks \\n\\nThe consultant told us We are completely in a limbo situation we have actions plans so know the areas \\nthat we need to improve We arent auditing the work we have just completed because we know its been \\ndone to a high standard and we are not auditing the other areas because we know that needs to be \\nupdated Any audits we did now would just prevent us fixing us things\\n\\nThis demonstrated a continuing breach of Regulation 17 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 Regulated \\nActivities Regulations 2014 need for good governance The action we have asked the provider to take can \\nbe found at the end of this report\\n\\nAt our comprehensive inspection in March and April 2017 we found the service to be noncomplaint with \\nRegulation 18 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 registration Regulations 2009 notification of other \\nincidents The registered manager failed to notify the Commission of two incidents where people had \\ninjured themselves and required hospital treatment \\n\\nDuring this inspection we reviewed the accident and incident records held at the service against the \\ninformation we had received from the provider We found that we had been informed of all notifiable events \\nas required The registered manager commented The incidents that didnt get reported were a mistake I \\nknow what needs to be reported We try to be open and transparent about everything that happens\\n\\nThe registered manager told us they had not been supported in their role to ensure positive outcomes for \\npeople They said The directors are very supportive in some areas but they dont have a background in \\ncare so when it came down to the residents I was left to get on with things myself I have had more support \\nfrom name of the consultant in the short time they have been here than I ever have before The consultant\\ntold us We know there are a lot of improvements to make I initially came on
